## Overview

Prompt Templates let you create reusable instruction sets that can be applied across multiple agents. Instead of writing prompts from scratch for each agent, use templates to ensure consistency and save time.

<Note>
Prompt Templates are organization-wide. Any team member can use templates created by others in the same organization.
</Note>
