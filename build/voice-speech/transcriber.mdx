## Overview

The transcriber is the first step in your agent's processing pipeline. It converts customer speech into text that the AI model can understand and respond to. Accurate transcription is critical—errors in this step cascade through the entire conversation.

<Note>
Configure transcriber under **Models > Transcriber** in your agent settings. Changes apply immediately.

## Keywords

Help your transcriber recognize brand names and technical terms accurately.

<Note>
Keywords are supported on Deepgram Nova-2 and Azure Speech models. Nova-3 does not currently support keywords.
</Note>

### What to Boost

Transcribers may struggle with:
- Brand names (company, products, competitors)
- Industry jargon (technical terms, acronyms)
- Proper nouns (people names, locations)

### How to Add Keywords

1. Open **Models > Transcriber**
2. Select a Deepgram Nova-2 or Azure Speech transcriber
3. In the **Recognition Keywords** section at the bottom, type keywords and press Enter after each one
4. Keywords are saved automatically

Add keywords on a per-need basis during testing. Review call transcripts for misheard words and add them as keywords to improve recognition.

---

## Testing Transcription

1. Place a test call and speak scenarios customers use (brand names, addresses)
2. Open conversation log and review transcript
3. Note any misheard words
4. Add recurring mistakes to keywords (if using Nova-2 or Azure)
5. Switch transcribers if issues persist

**What to test:**
- Brand names and product names
- Technical terminology
- Numbers and addresses
- Different accents and speech patterns
- Background noise conditions
