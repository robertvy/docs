## Overview

After selecting your voice, you can adjust provider-specific settings to fine-tune how it sounds. Available settings depend on which voice provider you've selected.

<Note>
Voice settings are displayed dynamically based on your selected voice. Changes apply immediately to new conversations.

## ElevenLabs Settings

ElevenLabs voices support the following adjustable parameters:

  </div>
</Frame>

### Stability

Controls consistency and expressiveness (range: 0.0-1.0, itellicoAI default: 0.71)

**How it works:**
- **Lower values (0.3-0.5):** More expressive and varied, but less consistent between generations
- **Medium values (0.5-0.7):** Balanced expressiveness and consistency (recommended)
- **Higher values (0.7-1.0):** More consistent and predictable, but may sound monotone

**Recommended starting point:** 0.5-0.7

Use lower stability for creative applications where variety is desired, and higher stability (0.6-0.85) for consistent customer service responses.

### Similarity Boost

Controls how closely the voice matches the original speaker (range: 0.0-1.0, itellicoAI default: 0.75)

**How it works:**
- **Lower values (0.5-0.7):** More creative interpretation of the voice
- **Medium values (0.75-0.8):** Balanced adherence to original voice (recommended)
- **Higher values (0.8-1.0):** Strict matching to original voice character

**Recommended starting point:** 0.75-0.8

Higher values increase computational load and can add latency. They're also more likely to reproduce artifacts if the source voice data is noisy.

### Style

Controls stylistic variation in pacing and intonation (range: 0.0-1.0, itellicoAI default: 0.0)

**How it works:**
- **0.0:** Neutral delivery (recommended)
- **0.5-1.0:** Amplified style of the original speaker

**Recommended starting point:** 0.0

Higher style values can make voices less stable and add latency. Keep this at 0 for most use cases.

### Speaker Boost

Enhances clarity and presence (boolean, itellicoAI default: enabled)

**How it works:**
- **Enabled:** Boosts similarity to the original speaker, improving clarity
- **Disabled:** Standard processing

**Recommended starting point:** Enabled

Increases latency slightly; subtle effect.

### Speed

Controls playback speed (range: 0.7-1.2, itellicoAI default: 1.0)

**Speed values:**
- **0.7-0.9:** Slower, clearer delivery
- **1.0:** Normal speed (default)
- **1.1-1.2:** Faster, more energetic delivery

**Recommended starting point:** 1.0

Adjust in small increments (0.05-0.1) and test with full conversations.

---

## Cartesia Settings

Cartesia voices support the following adjustable parameter:

### Speech Rate

Controls how fast the voice speaks (range: 0.5-2.0, default: 1.0)

**Speech rate values:**
- **0.5-0.8:** Slower delivery for clarity
- **1.0:** Normal speed (default)
- **1.2-2.0:** Faster delivery for efficiency

**Recommended starting point:** 1.0

Cartesia's ultra-low latency makes speed adjustments feel responsive. Test with realistic conversation scenarios.

## Azure Speech Settings

Azure Speech voices do not support adjustable settings through the itellicoAI interface. Azure uses default voice configurations optimized by Microsoft for each neural voice.

## Adjusting Settings

### How to Change Voice Settings

1. Navigate to **Voice** tab in your agent configuration
2. Your currently selected voice is displayed in the "Current Voice" card at the top
3. Click the **gear icon** next to your current voice (available for ElevenLabs and Cartesia voices)
4. A modal opens with adjustable parameters for your voice
5. Adjust sliders or toggles as needed
6. Click **Save Changes** to apply

## Best Practices

**Start with recommended defaults:** Itellico defaults are optimized starting points. ElevenLabs recommends stability ≈0.5 and similarity ≈0.75-0.8 as common baselines.

**Make small changes:** Voice settings are sensitive. Adjust in small increments and test after each change.

**Test in context:** Use full conversation scenarios (3-5 minutes), not just single-sentence samples.

**Consider your audience:** Older customers often prefer slightly slower speeds. Younger audiences may prefer slightly faster.

**Understand latency trade-offs:** Higher similarity boost and speaker boost increase latency. Style values >0 can also add latency and reduce stability.

**Document your settings:** Keep track of what works for each use case and voice combination.
