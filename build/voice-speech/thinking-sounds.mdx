## Overview

Thinking Sounds play subtle audio cues—like keyboard typing—while your agent processes responses. This adds realism to conversations by filling silence during LLM processing, function calls, or tool execution.

<Note>
When enabled, callers hear realistic keyboard typing sounds during processing, making it feel like someone is actively working on their request.
</Note>

## How It Works

Thinking Sounds are triggered during:

- **LLM processing:** While the AI model generates a response
- **Function calls:** When executing actions like calendar bookings or transfers
- **Tool execution:** During knowledge base searches or API calls
- **Complex reasoning:** Multi-step processes that take longer

The sounds stop automatically when the agent begins speaking the response.

---

## Configuration

Navigate to your agent's **Voice > Sound Effects** section.

### Enable Thinking Sounds

Toggle thinking sounds on or off:

- **Enabled:** Keyboard typing sounds play during processing
- **Disabled:** Silent processing (default)

## Best Practices

**Use sparingly:** Thinking sounds work best for occasional pauses. If your agent processes frequently, consider combining with Smart Filler instead.

**Match your use case:** Typing sounds work well for business contexts but may feel out of place for casual or entertainment applications.

**Test the experience:** Make several test calls to ensure thinking sounds enhance rather than distract from the conversation.

**Combine with other features:** Use alongside Smart Filler for comprehensive latency management—verbal acknowledgment plus audio feedback.

## Combining with Smart Filler

Thinking Sounds and Smart Filler complement each other:

| Feature | What it does | Best for |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Smart Filler | Verbal acknowledgment ("Let me check...") | Longer pauses (1-3+ seconds) |
| Thinking Sounds | Audio feedback (keyboard typing) | Shorter pauses (0.5-2 seconds) |
| Both together | Verbal + audio feedback | Complex processing |

**Recommendation:** Enable both for the most natural-feeling conversations.

## Technical Details

- **Sound type:** Realistic keyboard typing
- **Trigger:** Automatic during processing states
- **Duration:** Matches actual processing time
- **Blending:** Sounds fade naturally when speech begins
