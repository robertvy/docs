## Overview

Voice Cloning allows you to create custom voices from audio samples, giving your AI agent a unique voice that matches your brand identity. Upload a voice sample, and our system creates a synthetic voice your agent can use for all conversations.

<Note>
Voice cloning creates a synthetic voice based on your audio sample. The cloned voice will sound similar to the original but is generated by AI.

  <Accordion title="Recording environment" icon="microphone">
    Record in a quiet room with minimal echo. Avoid spaces with hard surfaces that create reverb.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Speaking style" icon="comment">
    Speak naturally as you would in conversation. Avoid overly dramatic or monotone delivery.
  </Accordion>

## Best Practices

**Get proper consent:** Always obtain written consent from the person whose voice you're cloning. This is both an ethical and legal requirement.

**Keep samples updated:** If the original voice changes significantly, consider updating the clone with a new sample.

**Test extensively:** Make test calls with the cloned voice to ensure it performs well across different conversation types.

**Have backups:** Keep the original voice sample files safely stored in case you need to re-clone.

---

## Legal Considerations

<Warning>
You must have explicit written consent from any person whose voice you clone. Unauthorized voice cloning may violate privacy laws and intellectual property rights.
</Warning>

**Before cloning, ensure you have:**

- Written consent from the voice owner
- Rights to use the voice commercially
- Clear agreement on how the voice will be used
- Documentation of the consent for your records

**Never clone:**
- Voices without consent
- Voices of public figures without licensing
- Voices for deceptive purposes

## Managing Cloned Voices

### Organization-Wide Access

Cloned voices are shared across your organization:

- All team members can assign cloned voices to their agents
- Voice management requires appropriate permissions
- Deleting a voice affects all agents using it

### Deleting a Cloned Voice

1. Navigate to **Voice > Voice Library > Cloned Voices**
2. Click the delete icon next to the voice
3. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
Deleting a cloned voice will affect all agents currently using it. Agents will fall back to the default voice until reconfigured.
</Warning>

---

## Limitations

- **Processing time:** Voice creation takes 1-5 minutes
- **Quality depends on sample:** Better input = better output
- **Language-specific:** Clones work best in the language of the sample
- **Not perfect copies:** Cloned voices are approximations, not exact replicas
