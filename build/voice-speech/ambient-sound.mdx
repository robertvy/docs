## Overview

Ambient sound adds subtle background audio behind your agent's voice, making conversations feel more natural and less sterile. From office ambience to café sounds, these audio layers create a sense of presence.

## How It Works

Ambient sound plays continuously in the background during conversations:

**What it does:**
- Adds environmental context (office, café, call center)
- Reduces the "sterile AI" feeling
- Makes pauses feel more natural (not dead silence)
- Creates atmosphere and personality

**What it shouldn't do:**
- Replace or drown out the agent's voice
- Distract customers from the conversation

When done right, customers barely notice it consciously—but the conversation feels more natural.

### Adjust Volume Level

After selecting a sound, adjust its volume relative to your agent's voice:

<Frame>
  <div className="block dark:hidden">
    <img src="/images/sounds/level-light.png" alt="Ambient Sounds volume configuration showing Background Sound dropdown with Open Plan Office selected, Volume Level slider ranging from -100% to +100% with current value at 0%, volume icon displaying 0%, and description explaining how to adjust volume relative to agent's voice" />
  </div>
  <div className="hidden dark:block">
    <img src="/images/sounds/level-dark.png" alt="Ambient Sounds volume configuration showing Background Sound dropdown with Open Plan Office selected, Volume Level slider ranging from -100% to +100% with current value at 0%, volume icon displaying 0%, and description explaining how to adjust volume relative to agent's voice" />
  </div>
</Frame>

1. Use the **Volume Level** slider
2. Range: **-100% to +100%**
   - **Negative values** (-100% to -1%): Quieter than voice (recommended)
   - **0%**: Same level as voice (rarely used)
   - **Positive values** (+1% to +100%): Louder than voice (use sparingly)

3. Changes save automatically as you adjust

## Best Practices

**Start subtle:** Begin with lower volumes (-80% to -60%) and increase only if needed. Ambience should be barely noticeable.

**Match your brand:** Choose sounds that align with your company's personality and industry.

**Test with real calls:** Make test calls to hear how ambience sounds in actual conversations, not just samples.

**Consider your audience:** Older customers or those with hearing difficulties may prefer no ambience or very low volumes.

**Avoid overuse:** Not every agent needs ambience. Use it when it enhances the experience, not by default.

## Testing Ambient Sound

After adding ambient sound:

1. Make test calls to your agent on different channels (phone and web)
2. Listen for the background ambience during pauses and while the agent speaks
3. Verify the volume is appropriate (not too loud or distracting)
4. Adjust volume if needed
5. Test with team members for feedback

**What to check:**
- Can you still clearly understand the agent's voice?
- Does the ambience feel natural or forced?
- Is the volume appropriate during pauses?
- Does it match your brand atmosphere?
- Does it work consistently across phone and web calls?

## Coming Soon: Backchanneling

Backchanneling (audio cues like "uh-huh", "yeah", "I see") will be available soon. These cues signal active listening and make conversations feel more natural.

Currently displayed in the UI under the **Backchanneling** tab with a "Coming Soon" badge.
