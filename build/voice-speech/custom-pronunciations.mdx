## Overview

Custom pronunciations let you define how specific words should sound, ensuring your agent always pronounces brand names, technical terms, and acronyms correctly.

**How it works:**
1. Agent generates response: "Call us at itellicoAI for help"
2. System applies pronunciation rules: "Call us at eye-tell-ee-co A I for help"
3. Voice synthesizer speaks the modified text
4. Customer hears correct pronunciation

<Note>
Pronunciation replacements are available under **Voice > Pronunciations** in your agent configuration.
</Note>

## Adding Pronunciations

### Single Replacement

1. Click **Add Replacement**
2. Enter the **target word** (the word to replace)
3. Enter the **pronunciation** (how it should sound)
4. Click **Add**

**Examples:**
- **Target:** Nike → **Pronunciation:** Nai-key
- **Target:** API → **Pronunciation:** A-P-I
- **Target:** 24/7 → **Pronunciation:** twenty-four seven
- **Target:** EST → **Pronunciation:** Eastern Time

<Warning>
**Target words must be single words only** - spaces are not allowed. Use complete words like `Nike` or `API`, not phrases like `customer service`.
</Warning>

### Bulk Import via CSV

For importing many pronunciations at once:

1. Click **Import CSV**
2. Download the template if needed
3. Prepare your CSV with two columns: `target`, `replacement`
4. Drag and drop your CSV file or click to select
5. Review the preview and click **Import**

**CSV format:**
```csv
target,replacement
Nike,Nai-key
EST,Eastern Time
24/7,twenty-four seven
API,A-P-I
```

**Limits:**
- Maximum 500 pronunciations per agent
- CSV file max size: 5MB

## Phonetic Spelling Tips

### Simple Phonetic Spelling

Write replacements as simple, readable phonetic text:

**Good examples:**
- Nike → Nai-key
- SQL → sequel (or) S-Q-L
- Wi-Fi → why-figh
- iOS → eye-oh-ess

**Tips:**
- Use hyphens to separate syllables: Nai-key, A-P-I
- Spell it like you'd explain pronunciation to someone
- Test with your voice to hear how it sounds

### Common Patterns

**Acronyms (spell out each letter):**
- API → A-P-I
- URL → U-R-L
- HTTP → H-T-T-P
- AWS → A-W-S

**Brand names (phonetic spelling):**
- Nike → Nai-key
- Adidas → ah-dee-dahs
- Chipotle → chih-poht-lay

**Numbers and time:**
- 24/7 → twenty-four seven
- 9am → nine A-M
- EST → Eastern Time
- 5pm → five P-M

**Technical terms:**
- SQL → sequel (or) S-Q-L
- API → A-P-I
- URL → you-are-ell
- WiFi → why-figh

## Advanced: IPA Phonemes

For precise pronunciation control, you can use International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) notation with the `<< >>` format:

**Format:** `<<phoneme|phoneme|phoneme>>`

**Example:**
```
espresso → <<ɛ|s|p|r|ɛ|s|oʊ>>
```

<Note>
IPA phonemes provide precise control but require knowledge of phonetic notation. Simple phonetic spelling (Nai-key) works well for most cases.
</Note>

## Managing Pronunciations

### Editing Existing Replacements

1. Click on any replacement chip in the list
2. Modify the target or pronunciation
3. Click **Save**

### Deleting Replacements

- Click the **trash icon** on any replacement chip to delete it
- Or click **Clear All** to remove all pronunciations (requires confirmation)

### Exporting Pronunciations

1. Click **Export CSV**
2. CSV file downloads with all your current pronunciations
3. Filename format: `{agent_name}_pronunciations.csv`

Use exported CSV files to back up your pronunciations or copy them to other agents.

## Testing Pronunciations

After adding pronunciations:

1. Make a test call to your agent
2. Trigger responses containing the target words
3. Listen to verify the pronunciation sounds correct
4. Adjust the phonetic spelling if needed

**Testing tips:**
- Test in context, not isolation
- Have team members listen
- Adjust hyphenation or spelling if it doesn't sound right

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with Common Issues" icon="bullseye">
    Add pronunciations for words you know are mispronounced in real calls. Review call transcripts to identify recurring pronunciation problems.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep It Simple" icon="sparkles">
    Use phonetic spelling (Nai-key) rather than complex IPA unless necessary. Simple phonetic text is easier to maintain and works well for most cases.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test Before Deploying" icon="vial">
    Always test pronunciations with real calls before going live. Make a test call and trigger responses containing the target words to verify they sound correct.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Your Rules" icon="file-arrow-down">
    Export your CSV regularly as backup. Use the Export CSV button to save your pronunciations and keep them versioned alongside your agent configuration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Consistent Spelling" icon="check">
    If you have "API" spelled out as "A-P-I", use that format consistently across all your pronunciations. Consistency improves maintainability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Single Words Only" icon="letter-a">
    Remember that target words cannot contain spaces - only complete single words work. Use `Nike` or `API`, not phrases like `customer service`.
