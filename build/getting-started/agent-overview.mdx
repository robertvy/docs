## What is an AI Voice Agent?

An AI voice agent is an intelligent virtual assistant that can handle voice conversations with your customers over phone and web. Unlike traditional IVR systems or chatbots, itellicoAI agents understand natural language, maintain context throughout conversations, and can take real actions like booking appointments, transferring calls, or updating your systems.

```

1. **Customer speaks** - Your customer asks a question or makes a request
2. **Transcriber** - The agent converts speech to text using advanced transcription
3. **AI reasoning** - The language model understands intent and formulates a response
4. **Knowledge retrieval** - Agent accesses your business knowledge when needed
5. **Action execution** - Agent can trigger bookings, transfers, or API calls
6. **Speech synthesis** - Response is converted to natural-sounding speech
7. **Agent responds** - Customer hears a helpful, contextual response
