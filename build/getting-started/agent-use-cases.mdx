## Multi-Channel Strategy

Many businesses deploy the same agent across multiple channels:

**Example: Customer Support Agent**
- **Phone number** for incoming support calls
- **Web widget** on help center and product pages
- **Outbound campaign** for proactive check-ins with customers

The agent has the same knowledge, personality, and capabilities - but introduces itself appropriately based on the channel.

**Example: Sales Agent**
- **Outbound campaign** for lead qualification
- **Phone number** for inbound callbacks from interested leads
- **Web widget** on pricing page to capture high-intent visitors
