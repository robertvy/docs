## How Agents Work

An itellicoAI agent is a single AI configuration that can be deployed across multiple channels simultaneously. The same agent can:
- Handle incoming phone calls
- Make outbound calls in campaigns
- Be embedded on your website as a widget
- Use different greetings for inbound vs outbound scenarios

You don't necessarily need to create separate "inbound" or "outbound" agents - the same agent can be deployed across multiple channels.

## Greeting Configuration

Since agents can be used for both incoming and outbound calls, you can configure greetings separately:

### Inbound Greeting
Used when customers call your phone number or start a web chat.

```text wrap
Hello! Thanks for calling Acme Support. How can I help you today?
```

### Outbound Greeting (Override)
Used when the agent makes outbound calls in campaigns.

```text wrap
Hi, this is Alex from Acme. You recently downloaded our guide. Do you have a quick moment to discuss how we can help?
```

<Tip>
Configure the outbound greeting override in **Abilities → Greeting → Outbound Override**. If not configured, the agent uses the inbound greeting for all calls.
</Tip>
