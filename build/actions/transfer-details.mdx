## Overview

The Transfer action is one of the most powerful call control tools, enabling your AI agents to seamlessly route conversations to the right destination when specialized help is needed. Whether transferring to human specialists, other AI agents, or external phone systems, proper transfer configuration ensures smooth handoffs that maintain customer satisfaction.

This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about transfer destinations, transfer modes, advanced settings, and best practices for reliable call routing.

<Note>
Transfers happen in real-time during active calls. The customer stays on the line while being connected to the new destination - they don't get hung up on or need to call back.
</Note>

    </Steps>

    ### Audio Settings

    Agent transfers support customizable hold music and ring tones:

    **Hold Music:**
    - Play music while the customer waits for the transfer to connect
    - Duration: 1-30 seconds (default: 6 seconds)
    - Use for: Professional experience during connection delays
    - Not recommended for: Instant transfers when immediate connection is preferred

    **Ring Duration:**
    - Play ringing sound while waiting for the destination agent to answer
    - Duration: 1-30 seconds (default: 4 seconds)
    - Enabled by default
    - Simulates normal calling experience

    **Combined Settings:**
    You can enable both for a complete transfer experience:
    1. Music plays (e.g., 6 seconds) - Professional hold experience
    2. Ringing plays (e.g., 4 seconds) - Connection in progress
    3. Agent answers - Transfer completes

    **Total delay:** Music duration + Ring duration (e.g., 10 seconds)

    <Info>
    For instant agent-to-agent transfers, disable both music and ringing for immediate connection.
    </Info>

      <Step title="Prerequisites">
        Before configuring SIP transfers:
        - SIP trunk configured in itellicoAI
        - Destination SIP endpoint reachable
        - Proper authentication configured
        - Network routing in place
      </Step>
      <Step title="Select transfer type">

        **Format requirements:**
        - Must be valid SIP URI
        - Include username and domain
        - Examples: `sip:support@pbx.company.com`, `sip:1234@10.0.1.50`
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Tip>
    SIP transfers are ideal for enterprises with existing phone systems. They provide seamless integration between AI agents and traditional telephony infrastructure.
    </Tip>

    <Warning>
    **SIP transfers only work during active phone calls.** They cannot be used during web calls or widget conversations.
    </Warning>

    ### Example Instructions

    ```
    For general support requests:

## Transfer Modes

### Cold Transfer (Default)

The agent transfers the call immediately and disconnects. The customer connects directly to the destination without the agent introducing them.

#### How It Works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Customer
    participant AI Agent
    participant Destination

    Customer->>AI Agent: Has issue/question
    AI Agent->>Customer: "Let me connect you to..."
    Note over AI Agent: Agent explains transfer
    AI Agent->>Destination: Initiates transfer
    Note over AI Agent: Agent disconnects
    Customer->>Destination: Connected directly
    Destination->>Customer: "Hello, how can I help?"
```

#### Example Flow

```
Customer: "I have a billing question"
Agent: "I'd be happy to help. Let me connect you with our billing
        department who can access your account details."
[Cold transfer to billing → Agent disconnects]
Billing Agent: "Hello, how can I help you?"
Customer: "I have a question about my bill..."
```

#### Silent Transfer Option

<Accordion title="Enable Silent Transfer (Optional)" icon="phone-slash">
  You can enable **Silent Transfer** mode where the agent transfers without saying anything - the call is immediately routed to the destination.

  **How it works:**
  1. Agent logic triggers transfer need
  2. Transfer executes without announcement
  3. Customer routed to destination silently

  **When to use:**
  - Pure routing, no conversation yet (IVR replacement)
  - Menu-based routing
  - Language detection and auto-routing

  **Configuration:**
  - Check the **Silent Transfer** checkbox
  - Any transfer message is ignored when silent mode is enabled

  **Example:**
  ```
  Agent: Language Router (silent routing agent)

  Instructions:
  Based on the language the customer speaks:
  - If Spanish detected, use 'Transfer to Spanish Agent' (silent)
  - If French detected, use 'Transfer to French Agent' (silent)
  - If English, continue conversation
  ```

  <Warning>
  Silent transfers can feel abrupt to customers. Use sparingly and only when appropriate for the use case.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

### Warm Transfer

<Card title="Coming Soon" icon="clock">
  **Warm transfers** use a three-way call approach: the customer hears hold music while the AI initiates a new call to the destination in the background. Once the destination answers, the AI provides context (via whisper message, summary, or three-way introduction) before connecting the customer. This ensures the receiving agent is briefed and prepared before speaking with the customer.

  **How it works:**

  1. Customer placed on hold (hears hold music)
  2. AI initiates new call to destination in background
  3. Destination answers, AI provides briefing
  4. Customer connected to briefed destination agent

  **Key difference from cold transfer:** AI maintains both call legs and briefs the destination before connecting the customer, rather than disconnecting immediately.

  This feature is currently in development and will be available in a future release.
</Card>

## Multi-Destination Support

Create multiple transfer actions for different destinations to handle various routing scenarios:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Complete Routing Configuration" icon="sitemap">
    Configure multiple transfer destinations for comprehensive routing:

    ```text wrap
    Agent: Customer Service Router

    Transfer Actions Configured:
    1. Transfer to Billing Department (+1-555-100-0001)
    2. Transfer to Technical Support (+1-555-100-0002)
    3. Transfer to Sales Team (+1-555-100-0003)
    4. Transfer to Returns Department (+1-555-100-0004)
    5. Transfer to Manager (sip:manager@pbx.company.com)
    6. Transfer to Spanish Agent (Agent ID: ag_spanish_01)

    Instructions:
    Route customers to appropriate department:

    Billing questions → 'Transfer to Billing Department'
    Technical issues → 'Transfer to Technical Support'
    Sales inquiries → 'Transfer to Sales Team'
    Return requests → 'Transfer to Returns Department'
    Escalations → 'Transfer to Manager'
    Spanish speakers → 'Transfer to Spanish Agent'

    Always explain who you're connecting them to before transferring.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Fallback Chains" icon="arrow-turn-down-right">
    Configure multiple transfer options with fallback logic:

    ```text wrap
    Primary escalation path:
    1. Attempt 'Transfer to Technical Support'
    2. If fails, attempt 'Transfer to General Support'
    3. If that fails, attempt 'Transfer to Manager'
    4. If all fail, apologize and schedule callback

    Instructions:
    If the primary transfer fails, the agent should try the backup,
    and handle complete failure gracefully by collecting callback info.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Conditional Routing" icon="code-branch">
    Use different transfers based on customer data or conversation context:

    ```jinja
    {% if contact_account_type == "enterprise" %}
    Route enterprise customers to 'Transfer to Enterprise Support'
    {% elif contact_account_type == "premium" %}
    Route premium customers to 'Transfer to Premium Support'
    {% else %}
    Route standard customers to 'Transfer to General Support'
    {% endif %}
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Always Explain the Transfer" icon="comment">
    Never transfer calls without context. Explain who you're connecting them to and why.

    **Good:**
    ```
    "I understand you need help with your bill. Let me connect you
    with our billing department who can access your account and
    make any necessary adjustments. This should just take a moment."
    ```

    **Poor:**
    ```
    "Hold please." [immediate transfer]
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set Customer Expectations" icon="clock">
    Tell customers what to expect during and after the transfer.

    **Good:**
    ```
    "I'm going to connect you with our technical team. You'll hear
    a brief hold message, then they'll pick up within 30 seconds.
    They'll have your information ready."
    ```

    **Poor:**
    ```
    "Transferring now." [customer doesn't know what's happening]
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Gather Information First" icon="clipboard">
    Collect basic details before transferring so the recipient has context and the customer doesn't need to repeat themselves.

    ```
    Before transferring:
    1. Get customer name
    2. Understand basic issue
    3. Collect account/order number if relevant
    4. Ask about urgency
    5. Then transfer with context
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Names" icon="tag">
    Name each transfer action clearly based on destination.

    **Good:**
    - "Transfer to Billing Department"
    - "Escalate to Technical Support"
    - "Route to Spanish-Speaking Agent"
    - "Connect to On-Call Manager"

    **Poor:**
    - "Transfer 1"
    - "Phone Transfer"
    - "Escalate"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Handle Transfer Failures" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Always have a plan for when transfers fail (busy, no answer, etc.).

    ```
    If 'Transfer to Support' action fails:
    1. Apologize: "I apologize, I'm having trouble connecting right now"
    2. Offer callback: "I can have our support team call you back
       within the next hour"
    3. Collect callback number and best time
    4. Confirm: "Great, expect a call from us at [number] within the hour"
    5. Use 'End Call Politely' action
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use E.164 Format for Phone Numbers" icon="phone">
    Always format phone numbers correctly to avoid transfer failures.

    **Correct E.164 format:**
    - Include country code: `+1` for US/Canada
    - No spaces, dashes, or punctheses
    - Examples: `+14155551234`, `+442071234567`

    **Incorrect formats:**
    - ❌ `(415) 555-1234`
    - ❌ `415-555-1234`
    - ❌ `14155551234` (missing +)
    - ❌ `+1 415 555 1234` (spaces)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider Costs for Phone Transfers" icon="dollar-sign">
    Be mindful of telephony costs, especially for international transfers.

    **Cost optimization:**
    - Use agent transfers when possible (free)
    - Use SIP transfers for internal routing (typically free or low-cost)
    - Limit phone transfers to necessary escalations
    - Monitor transfer frequency and costs
    - Set up alerts for unusual transfer volumes
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Testing Transfer Actions

Test all transfer destinations before going live to ensure reliable operation:

**Essential tests:**
- Transfer executes and destination receives call
- Audio quality is good in both directions
- Agent explains transfer appropriately in instructions
- Failure scenarios handled gracefully (no answer, busy signal, invalid destination)
- Test from different call sources (phone, web)

<Info>
For phone/SIP transfers, confirm proper E.164 formatting and destination reachability.
</Info>

  <Accordion title="Time-Based Routing" icon="clock">
    Route transfers based on time of day:

    ```jinja
    {% set current_hour = current_datetime | date('H') | int %}

    {% if current_hour >= 9 and current_hour < 17 %}
    Business hours: Use 'Transfer to Support Team'
    {% else %}
    After hours: Use 'Transfer to On-Call Support'
    {% endif %}
    ```

    <Info>
    The `current_datetime` variable must be passed to your agent via [Dynamic Context](/build/advanced/dynamic-context). Configure a context endpoint that returns this data in your agent's operational settings.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Skill-Based Routing" icon="user-gear">
    Route based on required expertise:

    ```text wrap
    Determine required skill:
    - Billing question → 'Transfer to Billing Specialist'
    - Technical issue → 'Transfer to Technical Support'
    - Product question → 'Transfer to Product Expert'
    - Account management → 'Transfer to Account Manager'

    Use customer's account type to influence routing:
    - VIP accounts always get priority queue transfers
    - Enterprise accounts route to dedicated support
    - Standard accounts route to general support queue
    ```
