## Overview

The Booking action lets your AI agents schedule appointments during live conversations. Integrated with Cal.com, your agents can check availability, present time slots, confirm bookings, and send automatic confirmations.

<Note>
Requires a Cal.com account and active integration. Works with Cal.com's free tier.
</Note>

<Info>
**How it works:** The booking action provides two functions to your agent:
1. **Get available slots** - Fetches available time slots from Cal.com
2. **Book appointment** - Creates the booking with customer details

This handles the core booking flow. For advanced workflows like confirming existing appointments, rescheduling, or cancelling, you'll need to build custom logic using [Custom API Actions](/build/actions/custom-api-actions) that integrate with the Cal.com API directly.
</Info>

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Cal.com Event Types">
    Set up event types in Cal.com for each appointment type:
    - Duration (15 min, 30 min, 60 min, etc.)
    - Meeting location (Zoom, Google Meet, phone, in-person)
    - Availability windows

    [Cal.com event types documentation](https://cal.com/docs/core-features/event-types)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Event Types">
    Book a test appointment in Cal.com to verify availability, meeting links, and notifications work correctly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Cal.com">
    Get your Cal.com API key and connect it to itellicoAI:

    1. Go to [Cal.com Settings → Developer → API Keys](https://app.cal.com/settings/developer/api-keys)
    2. Click **+ Add**, name it (e.g., "itellicoAI"), and save
    3. In itellicoAI, go to **Integrations → Cal.com**

## Using Your Existing Calendar System

A common question: **"We use Google Calendar / Microsoft Outlook / Microsoft 365. Can we still use Cal.com?"**

**Yes!** Cal.com integrates with your existing calendar system to prevent double bookings and check availability across all your calendars.

### How It Works

Cal.com connects to your company's calendar system (Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft 365, Exchange) and:

1. **Checks availability** - Reads your existing calendar to determine when you're free
2. **Prevents conflicts** - Cross-references all connected calendars before showing available slots
3. **Syncs bookings** - Adds confirmed appointments to your existing calendar automatically
4. **Updates in real-time** - When customers book through itellicoAI, the appointment appears in your company calendar immediately

<Note>
Cal.com acts as a scheduling layer on top of your existing calendar system. You continue using Google Calendar, Outlook, or Microsoft 365 as normal - Cal.com just reads availability and writes bookings to it.
</Note>

### Supported Calendar Systems

Cal.com integrates with:
- **Google Calendar** - Personal and Google Workspace accounts
- **Microsoft Outlook** - Outlook.com and Outlook desktop
- **Microsoft 365** - Business and enterprise accounts
- **Microsoft Exchange** - Exchange 2013, 2016, and newer
- **Apple Calendar** - iCloud calendar

### Setting Up Calendar Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Your Calendar to Cal.com">
    In Cal.com, go to **Settings → Calendars** and connect your calendar:

    - **Google Calendar**: Click "Connect" and authorize Cal.com
    - **Microsoft Outlook/365**: Click "Connect" and sign in with Microsoft
    - **Exchange**: Click "Connect" and enter your Exchange server details

    [Cal.com calendar connection guide](https://cal.com/docs)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Conflict Checking">
    Once connected, Cal.com automatically checks this calendar for conflicts. When someone tries to book with you:

    1. Cal.com checks all connected calendars
    2. Only shows times when you're actually available
    3. Prevents double bookings across all systems
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Booking Destination">
    Choose which calendar receives new bookings:

    - In Cal.com event type settings
    - Select the calendar where appointments should be created
    - This can be different from the calendars Cal.com checks for conflicts
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**Multiple calendars:** You can connect multiple calendars (e.g., personal Google Calendar + work Outlook). Cal.com checks all of them for conflicts and you choose which one receives new bookings.
</Info>

## Scheduling for Multiple Employees

A common scenario: **"We have 3 employees who can handle appointments, each with different availability. How do we schedule across the team?"**

**Solution:** Use Cal.com Teams with Round Robin scheduling. This distributes appointments across team members based on their individual availability.

### What is Cal.com Teams?

Cal.com Teams allows you to create event types that can be handled by multiple team members. Instead of booking with a specific person, customers book with your team, and Cal.com automatically assigns the appointment to an available team member.

<Note>
Cal.com Teams requires a Teams or Organization plan. The round robin feature intelligently distributes appointments based on availability, priority, or rotation.
</Note>

### How Round Robin Works

When a customer books an appointment:

1. **Checks availability** - Cal.com checks each team member's calendar
2. **Applies distribution logic** - Selects the best team member based on your chosen method:
   - **Priority**: Assign to higher-priority team members first
   - **Weighted**: Distribute proportionally (e.g., senior staff get more bookings)
   - **Least recently booked**: Rotate evenly by who was booked least recently
3. **Books with one person** - Customer gets scheduled with the selected team member
4. **Updates calendar** - Appointment appears in that team member's calendar

### Setting Up Team Event Types

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Team in Cal.com">
    In Cal.com:
    1. Go to **Teams** → **Create Team**
    2. Name your team (e.g., "Sales Team", "Support Team")
    3. Invite team members by email
    4. Each member connects their own calendar (Google, Microsoft, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Team Event Type">
    In your Cal.com team:
    1. Go to **Event Types** → **New Event Type**
    2. Select **Round Robin** as the event type
    3. Configure duration, meeting platform, etc.
    4. Select which team members can handle this event type
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Distribution Method">
    Choose how appointments are distributed:

    **Priority Ranking:**
    - Assign each team member a priority (High, Medium, Low)
    - Higher priority members get bookings first
    - Use for senior staff or specialists

    **Weighted Distribution:**
    - Give each member a weight percentage (default 100%)
    - Higher weights = more bookings
    - Use for part-time vs full-time staff

    **Least Recently Booked:**
    - Automatically rotates through team members
    - Ensures even distribution
    - Use for equal workload sharing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add to itellicoAI">
    Once your team event type is created:
    1. In itellicoAI, go to your agent → **Abilities → Actions**
    2. Click **Add Action** → **Calendar Booking**
    3. Select your team event type from the dropdown
    4. The booking action will now schedule with your team
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Advanced: Fixed + Round Robin Hosts

For scenarios where one person must always attend, while others rotate:

**Example:** Sales calls need a sales rep (rotating) + sales manager (always present)

**Setup in Cal.com:**
1. Create round robin event type
2. Select **Fixed Hosts**: Sales Manager (always attends)
3. Select **Round Robin Hosts**: Sales reps (one attends per call)
4. Cal.com checks availability for both and books when both are free

### Team Scheduling Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sales Team: 3 Reps with Equal Distribution" icon="users">
    **Scenario:** 3 sales reps should share demo calls equally

    **Setup:**
    - Create team "Sales Team" with 3 members
    - Use **Least Recently Booked** distribution
    - Each rep connects their calendar to Cal.com
    - Create event type "Sales Demo" (30 min, round robin)

    **Result:** Demos are automatically distributed evenly. Rep availability is checked in real-time from their individual calendars.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Support Team: Priority-Based Assignment" icon="headset">
    **Scenario:** Senior support staff should get complex issues, junior staff get routine issues

    **Setup:**
    - Create event type "Technical Support Call" with priority distribution
    - Senior staff: High priority
    - Junior staff: Medium priority

    **Result:** Senior staff get booked first when available. Junior staff handle overflow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Part-Time Team: Weighted Distribution" icon="clock">
    **Scenario:** 2 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee

    **Setup:**
    - Full-time staff: 100% weight each
    - Part-time staff: 50% weight
    - Use weighted distribution

    **Result:** Part-timer gets half as many bookings as full-time staff.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multi-Role Meetings" icon="user-group">
    **Scenario:** Customer needs both a technical specialist and account manager

    **Setup:**
    - Use **Round Robin Groups** (advanced feature)
    - Group 1: Technical specialists (one attends)
    - Group 2: Account managers (one attends)

    **Result:** Cal.com selects one person from each group, ensuring both roles are covered.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Team Integration with itellicoAI

When you connect a Cal.com team event type to itellicoAI:

1. **Your AI agent books with the team** - Not a specific person
2. **Cal.com handles assignment** - Automatically selects the best team member
3. **Customer gets confirmation** - With the assigned team member's details
4. **Team member's calendar updates** - Appointment appears in their individual calendar

**In your agent instructions:**

```
When a customer wants to schedule a consultation:

1. Use 'Book Team Consultation' action
2. The system will automatically assign an available team member
3. Confirm: "Perfect! You're scheduled with [assigned team member]
   on [date] at [time]. You'll receive a confirmation email."
```

<Info>
**Flexibility:** Team members can update their individual Cal.com availability, and the round robin automatically respects those changes. No need to update anything in itellicoAI.
</Info>

---

## Using in Instructions

Reference the action by its auto-generated name (e.g., "Book 30-Minute Consultation") in your agent instructions:

```
When a customer wants to schedule a consultation:

1. Confirm: "I'd be happy to schedule that for you"
2. Ask availability: "What days work best this week?"
3. Collect email if needed
4. Use 'Book 30-Minute Consultation' action to present times
5. Confirm verbally: "Perfect! You're all set for [day] at [time].
   You'll receive a confirmation email with the meeting link."
```

<Info>
The action name is automatically generated from your Cal.com event type title (e.g., "30-Minute Consultation" becomes "Book 30-Minute Consultation").
</Info>

### Handle Booking Failures

```
If 'Book 30-Minute Consultation' fails:

1. Apologize: "I'm having trouble accessing the calendar right now"
2. Offer alternative:
   - "I can have someone call you back to schedule"
   - Collect callback number and best time
3. If no availability: "We're fully booked for [timeframe].
   Would [alternative timeframe] work?"
```
