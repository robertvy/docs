## Overview

Conversation goals are optional metrics that help you measure success. Define what outcomes matter to you, and AI will analyze each conversation transcript to determine if those goals were achieved. This enables performance reporting, success rate tracking, and data-driven optimization.

<Warning>
**Goals are for reporting only.** The agent doesn't know about goals during the conversation. Goals are evaluated by AI after the call ends by analyzing the transcript.

To guide the agent's behavior during calls, define what you want the agent to accomplish in your [agent instructions](/build/conversation/instructions).
</Warning>

**Access:** Agent settings → **Analytics → Goals**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Goals">
    Agent settings → **Analytics → Goals** → **Add Goal**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose goal type (optional)">
    **Primary Goal:** Your main success metric
    - The most important outcome to measure for this agent
    - Used to calculate overall conversation success rate
    - Example: "Appointment booked"

    **Secondary Goals:** Additional metrics
    - Track extra outcomes without affecting primary success rate
    - Measure additional value delivered
    - Example: "Email collected"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure goal">
    **Name:** Clear, concise label
    ```
    Example: "Follow-up meeting scheduled"
    ```

    **Description:** What success looks like (be as specific as possible - AI uses this to evaluate)
    ```
    Example: "A follow-up meeting was successfully scheduled with
    a specific confirmed date, time, and list of attendees. The
    customer agreed to the scheduled time and received confirmation."
    ```

    <Tip>
    More specific descriptions = more accurate goal evaluation

## Primary vs Secondary Goals

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Primary Goal">
    **Optional.** Choose the single most important outcome to measure.

    <Info>
    **Why only one primary goal?** Having one primary goal defines your main success metric. Conversations are considered successful if the primary goal is achieved, making your analytics dashboard easier to interpret.
    </Info>

    **Examples:**
    - 📅 Appointment booked
    - ✅ Lead qualified
    - 🔧 Issue resolved
    - 💳 Payment collected
    - 📞 Callback scheduled

    **Reporting:**
    - Used to calculate overall success rate
    - Primary metric in analytics dashboard
    - Determines if conversation was successful
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Secondary Goals">
    **Optional. Multiple allowed.** Additional outcomes to track.

    **Examples:**
    - 📧 Email collected
    - ⭐ Feedback gathered
    - 💰 Upsell opportunity identified
    - 📝 Contact information updated
    - ✓ Preferences confirmed

    **Reporting:**
    - Tracked separately from primary goal
    - Doesn't affect overall success rate
    - Measures additional value delivered
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Write Clear Descriptions" icon="pen">
    The AI uses your description to evaluate goal completion.

    ❌ Vague: "Get customer info"

    ✅ Clear: "Collect customer's full name, email address, phone number, and reason for inquiry"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Start with One Primary Goal" icon="bullseye">
    Don't try to accomplish too much in one call.

    ✅ Focus: One clear primary objective

    ❌ Overload: Multiple competing primary goals
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Secondary Goals Strategically" icon="list">
    Secondary goals track additional value beyond your primary metric.

    **Examples:**
    - Primary: "Appointment booked" + Secondary: "Email collected"
    - Primary: "Issue resolved" + Secondary: "Feedback gathered"
    - Primary: "Lead qualified" + Secondary: "Demo scheduled"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Archive Outdated Goals" icon="folder">
    Archive old goals to keep them out of the way while preserving historical data.

    **To archive:** Click archive icon next to goal

    **To restore:** Click "View Archived" → Restore
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips

- **Align instructions with goals** - While the agent doesn't see goals during calls, write your agent instructions to guide conversations toward achieving your defined goals
- **Review regularly** - Check goal achievement rates weekly to identify optimization opportunities
- **Refine definitions** - Adjust goal descriptions if AI evaluation doesn't match your expectations
- **Combine with analysis** - Use [Post-Call Analysis](/build/analytics/post-call-analysis) for detailed quality scoring

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Goals not showing in conversations" icon="eye-slash">
    **Causes:**
    - Goals created after conversations took place
    - Goals archived

    **Solutions:**
    - Goals only apply to new conversations after creation
    - Check archived goals (click "View Archived")
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Inaccurate goal evaluation" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Causes:**
    - Vague goal description
    - Description doesn't match actual success criteria

    **Solutions:**
    - Make description more specific and detailed

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Low achievement rates" icon="chart-column">
    **Causes:**
    - Goal too ambitious for conversation type
    - Agent instructions don't align with goal
    - Goal description not specific enough

    **Solutions:**
    - Review if goal is realistic for your use case
