## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Post-Call Emails">
    Agent editor → **Analytics → Post-Call Emails** → **Create Email**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose starting point (optional)">
    **Templates** provide pre-configured triggers and content for common use cases:

    - **Callback Requested** - Customer asks for follow-up
    - **Appointment Booked** - Meeting/consultation scheduled
    - **Customer Complaint** - Escalates dissatisfaction
    - **Unanswered Question** - Agent couldn't answer
    - **Technical Issue** - Routes bugs/errors to tech teams
    - **Billing Inquiry** - Payment/invoice questions
    - **Escalation Needed** - Requires management attention
    - **Order Placed** - Purchase confirmation
    - **Demo Request** - Product demonstration interest
    - **Positive Feedback** - Share compliments with team

    <Info>
    Templates are fully customizable starting points. You can also start from scratch.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure notification name">
    **Name:** Internal identifier (e.g., "Callback Request Alert")
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set trigger condition">
    Describe when to send (AI analyzes this against call transcript):

    ```
    Example: "Did the customer request a callback, ask to be
    contacted later, or want someone to follow up with them?"
    ```

    <Tip>
    Be specific. The more detailed your trigger description, the more accurate the AI matching.
    </Tip>

    **Or:** Toggle "Always send after every call" to bypass condition checking
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure recipients">
    **Fixed Recipients:** Enter specific email addresses (supports multiple)

    ```
    Example: support@company.com, manager@company.com
    ```

    **Dynamic Recipients (AI-powered):** AI routes to different recipients based on call content

    ```
    Example: Route complaints by severity
    - If legal threat → legal@company.com
    - If angry/canceling → retention@company.com
    - If product issue → quality@company.com
    - Otherwise → support@company.com

    Example: Route technical issues by type
    - If website issue → dev@company.com
    - If billing system → billing-tech@company.com
    - Otherwise → tech-support@company.com

    Example: Route orders by value
    - If order over $1000 → sales-manager@company.com
    - Otherwise → orders@company.com
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Design email template">
    **Subject:** `Callback requested`

    **Body:** Use rich text editor with variables (see [Template Variables](#template-variables) below)

    - **System variables:** Click variable picker to insert (e.g., `{{customer_name}}`, `{{conversation_summary}}`)
    - **Dynamic variables:** Type `{{dyn_` + descriptive name (e.g., `{{dyn_appointment_date}}`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and enable">
    Save notification → Toggle **Enabled** switch
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Template Variables

### System Variables

Use the **variable picker** in the editor to insert these.

<Info>
**Availability:** Some variables only populate under certain conditions:
- Phone numbers (`customer_number`, `to_number`) - Phone calls only
- Customer data (`customer_name`, `customer_email`) - Only if caller exists as a contact in your system
- Conversation transcript - Only if transcription is enabled
</Info>

**Conversation Details:**
- `{{conversation_date}}` - Full date/time in 24-hour format
- `{{conversation_time}}` - Time in 12-hour format
- `{{conversation_duration}}` - Duration in MM:SS format
- `{{conversation_status}}` - Status (Completed, Failed, etc.)
- `{{conversation_direction}}` - Inbound/Outbound
- `{{conversation_summary}}` - AI-generated summary
- `{{conversation_transcript}}` - Full transcript with fallback text
- `{{transcript}}` - Simple transcript (no fallback)
- `{{conversation_url}}` - Link to view conversation
- `{{conversation_uuid}}` - Unique identifier

**Agent & Account:**
- `{{agent_name}}` - Name of AI agent
- `{{account_name}}` - Your organization name

**Customer Information** (only if contact exists):
- `{{customer_number}}` - Customer phone number (phone calls only)
- `{{customer_name}}` - Customer name (if contact exists)
- `{{customer_email}}` - Customer email (if contact exists)
- `{{to_number}}` - Called phone number (phone calls only)

### Dynamic Variables

**How they work:** Type `{{dyn_` followed by a descriptive name. AI analyzes the call transcript and extracts the information.

**Examples:**
```
{{dyn_appointment_date}} → AI finds the date mentioned in call
{{dyn_appointment_time}} → AI finds the time mentioned
{{dyn_issue_summary}} → AI summarizes the problem discussed
{{dyn_ticket_number}} → AI locates any ticket reference
{{dyn_next_steps}} → AI identifies agreed action items
{{dyn_shipping_address}} → AI extracts mentioned address
{{dyn_order_number}} → AI finds order reference
```

<Tip>
The variable name guides the AI. More specific names = better extraction accuracy.

✅ `{{dyn_rescheduled_appointment_date}}`
❌ `{{dyn_date}}`
</Tip>
