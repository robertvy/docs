## Overview

Post-call analysis uses AI to extract structured information from conversation transcripts. Define what you want the AI to analyze (quality scores, sentiment, categories, extracted data) and get consistent, actionable insights from every call.

**Access:** Agent settings → **Call Analysis**

    <img src="/images/postcalls/postcall-light.png" alt="Call Analysis configuration interface showing navigation sidebar with Analytics section expanded and Call Analysis selected, Default Analyses and Custom Analyses tabs with Default Analyses active showing 13 analyses, expandable categories including Communication (3), Interaction (4), Knowledge (2), Sentiment (2), and Technical (2) with chevron icons, and Add Analysis button in top right" />

<Warning>
**Analysis vs Goals:** Analysis extracts information and judges quality (e.g., "How satisfied was the customer?"). Goals track conversions (e.g., "Was appointment booked?"). Use both together for complete reporting.
</Warning>

## Analysis Language

Set the language for AI analysis evaluation:

**Access:** Agent settings → **Analytics → Language**

Select the language in which goals and analytics will be evaluated. This determines what language the AI uses when analyzing transcripts and answering analysis questions.

**Example:** If you set analysis language to Spanish, the AI will evaluate conversations in Spanish, even if your agent speaks English to customers.

<Tip>
This setting applies to both Call Analysis and Goals evaluation.
</Tip>

## Analysis vs Goals

Use both together for complete conversation tracking:

| Feature | Goals | Analysis |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Purpose** | Track conversions | Extract insights & judge quality |
| **Example** | "Appointment booked" | "How satisfied was customer?" |
| **Answer Type** | Achieved/Not achieved | Yes/No, Text, or 1-5 rating |
| **Use For** | Success metrics | Quality scoring, categorization |
| **Best For** | Business outcomes | Detailed reporting |

**Example combination:**
- **Goal:** "Appointment booked" (Did we achieve the conversion?)
- **Analysis:** "Customer Satisfaction" (How well did we do it?)
- **Analysis:** "Primary Call Topic" (What did they want?)

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Write Specific Questions" icon="pen">
    The AI uses your description to answer. Be detailed.

    ❌ Vague: "Was the call good?"

    ✅ Specific: "Did the agent provide accurate information, address all customer questions, and maintain a professional tone throughout the call?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Define Rating Scales" icon="star">
    For rating questions, always define what each level means.

    ```
    Rate agent professionalism (1-5):
    5 = Exceptionally professional
    4 = Very professional
    3 = Professional
    2 = Somewhat unprofessional
    1 = Unprofessional
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Start with Key Questions" icon="list">
    Don't create too many analyses at once. Start with 3-5 critical questions:

    1. Issue resolved (Yes/No)
    2. Customer satisfaction (Rating)
    3. Call topic (Open)
    4. Sentiment (Rating)

    Add more as needed.
  </Accordion>
