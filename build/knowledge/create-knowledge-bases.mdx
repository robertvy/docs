## Overview

Creating a knowledge base is your first step toward giving your AI agent expert-level knowledge of your business. This guide walks you through the complete process, from creating the knowledge base to organizing content and following best practices.

<Tip>
Plan your knowledge structure before you start. A well-organized knowledge base is easier to maintain and more effective for your agents.
</Tip>

---

## Step 1: Create a Knowledge Base

### Navigate to Knowledge Bases

1. Log into your [itellicoAI dashboard](https://app.itellico.ai)
2. Click **Knowledge Bases** in the left navigation menu
3. Click the **+ Create Knowledge Base** button

### Fill in Basic Information

<Frame>
  <div className="block dark:hidden">
    <img src="/images/knowledgebase/create-light.png" alt="Create Knowledge Base dialog with name and description fields" />
  </div>
  <div className="hidden dark:block">
    <img src="/images/knowledgebase/create-dark.png" alt="Create Knowledge Base dialog with name and description fields" />
  </div>
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Knowledge Base Name">
    Choose a clear, descriptive name that reflects the content category.

    **Naming rules:**
    - Letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, and underscores only
    - No special characters (@, #, $, etc.)
    - Maximum 100 characters

    **Good examples:**
    - "Customer Support FAQ"
    - "Product Documentation"
    - "Company Policies"
    - "Technical Troubleshooting"

    **Avoid:**
    - "KB_001" (not descriptive)
    - "Misc Docs" (too vague)
    - "Everything!!!" (unprofessional)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Description (Optional)">
    Provide context about what this knowledge base contains and when to use it.

    **Example descriptions:**
    - "Customer-facing support documentation including FAQs, policies, and troubleshooting guides"
    - "Internal product specifications, feature documentation, and technical details"
    - "Company HR policies, compliance documents, and internal procedures"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Create">
    Your knowledge base is now created and ready for content!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Organize with Folders

Folders organize your knowledge items into logical groups.

<Note>
A default folder is automatically created when you create a new knowledge base. You can rename it, add more folders, or start adding items right away.
</Note>

### Add Additional Folders (Optional)

1. Open your knowledge base
2. Click the **Create Folder** button
3. Enter a folder name
4. Add an optional description
5. Click **Create**

### Folder Naming Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Clear & Specific" icon="check">
    - "Billing & Payments"
    - "Return Policies"
    - "Product Specifications"
    - "Technical Issues"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Vague or Generic" icon="xmark">
    - "Stuff"
    - "Folder 1"
    - "Docs"
    - "Misc"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### How Many Folders?

<Accordion title="Small Knowledge Base (< 50 items)">
  **3-5 folders** is usually sufficient

  **Example structure:**
  - Customer Questions
  - Company Policies
  - Product Information
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Medium Knowledge Base (50-200 items)">
  **5-10 folders** provides good organization

  **Example structure:**
  - Billing & Payments
  - Technical Support
  - Product Features
  - Account Management
  - Shipping & Returns
  - General FAQ
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Large Knowledge Base (200+ items)">
  **10-15 folders** keeps things manageable

  Consider splitting into multiple knowledge bases if you exceed 15 folders.

  **Example structure:**
  - Account Setup
  - Billing Issues
  - Payment Methods
  - Refunds & Credits
  - Product Categories A-F
  - Product Categories G-M
  - Product Categories N-Z
  - Technical Troubleshooting
  - Integration Guides
  - API Documentation
  - Returns & Exchanges
  - Shipping Options
  - Order Tracking
</Accordion>

## Step 3: Add Knowledge Items

Knowledge items are the actual content - the documents, FAQs, policies, and information you want your agent to know.

<Frame>
  <div className="block dark:hidden">
    <img src="/images/knowledgebase/add-items-light.png" alt="Create New Item dialog showing Text Content, Upload File, and Web Page options" />
  </div>
  <div className="hidden dark:block">
    <img src="/images/knowledgebase/add-items-dark.png" alt="Create New Item dialog showing Text Content, Upload File, and Web Page options" />
  </div>
</Frame>

You can add knowledge items in three different ways. Choose the method that best fits your content:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Text Entry - Write content directly" icon="text">
    **Best for:** FAQs, policies, procedures, quick reference information

    Direct text entry using the built-in editor. Perfect for content you're creating specifically for your knowledge base.

    ### How to Add a Text Item

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Add Knowledge Item'">
    In your folder, click the add button to create a new item.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select 'TEXT' as category">
    Choose text if you're entering content directly.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter a descriptive title">
    **Good titles:**
    - "Return Policy for Digital Products"
    - "Password Reset Instructions"
    - "Pricing Tiers Explained"

    **Avoid:**
    - "Doc 1"
    - "Policy"
    - "Info"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write or paste your content">
    Enter the information you want your agent to know. Be clear and comprehensive.

    **Example:**
    ```
    Return Policy for Digital Products

    Digital products can be refunded within 30 days of purchase if:
    1. The product has a technical defect that prevents usage
    2. The product description was materially inaccurate
    3. The customer has not accessed or downloaded the product

    Refunds are not available for:
    - Change of mind after accessing the product
    - Compatibility issues that were disclosed in product description
    - User error or misunderstanding of features

    To request a refund, customers should email support@company.com
    with their order number and reason for the refund request.

    Processing time: 5-7 business days
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Create'">
    Your knowledge item is saved and will be processed immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="File Upload - Upload existing documents" icon="file-arrow-up">
    **Best for:** User manuals, product specs, legal documents, training materials

    Upload documents in various formats up to 10MB. The system extracts and processes the text content.

    **Supported formats:** PDF, Word (.doc, .docx), Text (.txt, .log), Markdown (.md), CSV/TSV, JSON, YAML, XML

    ### How to Add a File

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Add Knowledge Item'">
    In your folder, click the add button.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select 'FILE' as category">
    Choose file for document uploads.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter a title">
    Give your file a descriptive title (the filename will be stored separately).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload your file">
    Click **Upload** and select your document.

    **Requirements:**
    - Supported formats: PDF, Word (.doc, .docx), Text (.txt, .log), Markdown (.md), CSV/TSV, JSON, YAML, XML
    - Maximum size: 10MB
    - Text-based documents and scanned images (advanced parsing handles most scans)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Create'">
    The system will upload and begin processing your file. Status will change from PENDING → PROCESSING → COMPLETED.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
File processing time varies based on file size and complexity. Large files (5-10MB) may take several minutes to process.
</Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="URL Scraping - Pull content from web pages" icon="link">
    **Best for:** Documentation pages, blog posts, help articles, external resources

    Scrape content from a single web page (not entire websites).

    ### How to Add a URL

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Add Knowledge Item'">
    In your folder, click the add button.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select 'URL' as category">
    Choose URL to scrape web content.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter a title">
    Give the content a descriptive title.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter the source URL">
    Paste the complete URL including https://

    **Example:**
    ```
    https://docs.company.com/api/authentication
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Create'">
    The system will fetch and process the web page content. Status will change from PENDING → PROCESSING → COMPLETED.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
URL scraping works best with simple, text-based web pages. Complex JavaScript applications or pages requiring authentication may not scrape successfully.
</Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Understanding Processing Statuses

After adding a knowledge item, it goes through two separate processing pipelines. You'll see both statuses in the interface:

### Content Processing Status

This tracks whether the content was successfully extracted from your source.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="PENDING" icon="clock">
    Item created and queued for processing. Usually takes just a few seconds.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="PROCESSING" icon="spinner">
    Content is being processed right now:
    - **Files**: Parsing documents using our advanced AI document parsers
    - **URLs**: Fetching and scraping the web page
    - **Text**: Skips this (goes directly to COMPLETED)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="COMPLETED" icon="check">
    Content successfully extracted and stored. Vector indexing will begin automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="FAILED" icon="xmark">
    Content extraction failed. Common causes:
    - File is corrupted or password-protected
    - URL requires authentication or uses complex JavaScript
    - File exceeds 10MB limit

    **Quick fixes:**
    - Try uploading the content as TEXT instead
    - Remove password protection from the file
    - Split large files into smaller documents

    <Warning>
    **Need help?**

    If the issue persists, contact our support team at **support@itellico.ai** with:
    - The knowledge item title
    - File type or URL you're trying to add
    - Any error message shown
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Vector Indexing Status

After content is extracted, it must be indexed for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). This allows your agent to find relevant knowledge based on meaning.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="PENDING" icon="clock">
    Waiting for vector indexing to start. Content processing completed successfully.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="INDEXING" icon="spinner">
    Creating vector embeddings for RAG:
    - Content is split into chunks
    - AI embeddings are generated
    - Vectors are stored in the database

    This can take several minutes for large documents.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="INDEXED" icon="check">
    Item is fully ready! The agent can now find and use this knowledge via semantic search.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="FAILED" icon="xmark">
    Vector indexing failed. The content is extracted but won't appear in RAG search results.

    **Quick fixes:**
    - Click the **Reindex** button on the knowledge item to retry indexing
    - If reindexing fails, try deleting and re-creating the item
    - Ensure the content isn't too short (needs at least a few sentences)

    <Warning>
    **Need help?**

    If reindexing doesn't work, contact our support team at **support@itellico.ai** with:
    - The knowledge item title
    - When you created the item
    - Content type (TEXT, FILE, or URL)
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
**Both statuses must succeed for full functionality:**
- Content Status: **COMPLETED**
- Vector Status: **INDEXED**

Only then can your agent use the knowledge in conversations.
</Note>

## Content Quality Guidelines

### Write Clear, Comprehensive Content

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific and detailed" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Don't assume knowledge. Explain clearly.

    **Instead of:**
    "Customers can return items within our standard window."

    **Write:**
    "Customers can return items within 30 days of purchase. Items must be unused and in original packaging with all tags attached."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use plain language" icon="comment">
    Avoid jargon unless it's industry-standard and your audience knows it.

    **Instead of:**
    "Utilize the authentication endpoint to generate a bearer token."

    **Write:**
    "To authenticate, call the /auth endpoint. You'll receive an access token to include in subsequent requests."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Include examples" icon="list-check">
    Examples make abstract concepts concrete.

    **Example:**
    "Our pricing tiers include:
    - Basic: $29/month - Up to 1,000 contacts
    - Pro: $99/month - Up to 10,000 contacts
    - Enterprise: Custom pricing - Unlimited contacts"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Structure with headings" icon="heading">
    Use headings and bullet points for scannable content.

    **Good structure:**
    ```
    Return Policy

    Eligible Items:
    - Unopened products in original packaging
    - Items purchased within 30 days
    - Products without signs of use

    Non-Eligible Items:
    - Digital downloads
    - Personalized products
    - Sale items marked as final sale

    Process:
    1. Email support@company.com
    2. Provide order number
    3. Receive return authorization
    4. Ship item within 7 days
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep content focused" icon="bullseye">
    Each item should cover one topic thoroughly. Split large topics into multiple items.

    **Instead of:**
    One 20-page "Complete Company Handbook"

    **Create:**
    - Return Policy
    - Shipping Options
    - Payment Methods
    - Product Warranty
    - Privacy Policy
    - Contact Information
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
