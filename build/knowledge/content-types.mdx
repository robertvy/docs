## File Upload Items

### What Are File Upload Items?

File upload items allow you to upload existing documents in various formats. The system extracts the text content and makes it available to your agents.

### When to Use File Uploads

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Existing documentation" icon="file">
    You already have content in document format.

    **Examples:**
    - User manuals
    - Product specifications
    - Legal documents
    - Training materials
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Formatted documents" icon="file-pdf">
    Documents with specific layouts that are easier to maintain as files.

    **Examples:**
    - Technical diagrams
    - Tables and charts
    - Multi-column layouts
    - Branded templates
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Third-party documents" icon="building">
    Documentation you receive from vendors or partners.

    **Examples:**
    - Supplier catalogs
    - Compliance documents
    - Certification materials
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### File Requirements

**File specifications:**
- **Formats:** PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, and other document formats
- **Size limit:** 10MB maximum
- **Content:** Text-based documents and scanned images (advanced parsing handles most scans)
- **Protection:** No password protection

<Note>
The system uses advanced document parsing to extract text from scanned images and PDFs. Most scanned documents will process correctly, though very poor quality scans may require manual text entry.
</Note>

### Creating File Items

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to folder">
    Open the folder where you want to add the file.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Add Knowledge Item'">
    Click the button to create a new item.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select 'FILE' category">
    Choose FILE from the content type options.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter title">
    Give your file a descriptive title (this is separate from the filename).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload file">
    Click **Upload** and select your document from your computer.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Create'">
    The system will upload and begin processing your file.

    Status progression:
    - PENDING → File uploaded, queued for processing
    - PROCESSING → Extracting text content
    - COMPLETED → Ready for use
    - FAILED → Processing error occurred
  </Step>
</Steps>

### File Item JSON Example

```json wrap
{
  "category": "FILE",
  "title": "User Manual - Product X",
  "file": "/uploads/knowledge/user-manual-product-x.pdf",
  "status": "COMPLETED"
}
```

### Processing Time

File processing time varies based on:
- **File size:** Larger files take longer
- **Page count:** More pages = longer processing
- **Complexity:** Tables, images, and complex layouts slow processing
- **Text quality:** Clean, simple text extracts faster

**Typical processing times:**
- Small files (< 1MB, 10 pages): 10-30 seconds
- Medium files (1-5MB, 10-50 pages): 30-90 seconds
- Large files (5-10MB, 50+ pages): 2-5 minutes

### Common File Issues

<AccordionGroup>

## URL Items

### What Are URL Items?

URL items scrape content from web pages and store it in your knowledge base. This is useful for referencing online documentation, help centers, or blog posts.

### When to Use URL Items

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Public documentation" icon="globe">
    Reference external documentation you don't maintain.

    **Examples:**
    - API documentation (your own or third-party)
    - Public knowledge bases
    - Help center articles
    - Product pages
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Frequently updated content" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Content that changes regularly and you want to keep current by re-scraping.

    **Examples:**
    - Pricing pages
    - Product availability

    - Status pages
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Blog posts or articles" icon="newspaper">
    Educational content or announcements.

    **Examples:**
    - How-to guides
    - Best practices articles
    - Product announcements
    - Feature tutorials
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Creating URL Items

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to folder">
    Open the folder where you want to add the URL.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Add Knowledge Item'">
    Click the button to create a new item.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select 'URL' category">
    Choose URL from the content type options.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter title">
    Give the content a descriptive title.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter source URL">
    Paste the complete URL including https://

    **Example:**
    ```
    https://docs.company.com/api/authentication
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Create'">
    The system will fetch and process the web page.

    Status progression:
    - PENDING → URL queued for scraping
    - PROCESSING → Fetching and extracting content
    - COMPLETED → Content available
    - FAILED → Scraping error occurred
  </Step>
</Steps>

### URL Item JSON Example

```json wrap
{
  "category": "URL",
  "title": "API Authentication Documentation",
  "source_url": "https://docs.company.com/api/authentication",
  "status": "COMPLETED"
}
```

### URL Requirements

**Working URLs:**
- Publicly accessible (no login required)
- Simple HTML content pages
- Documentation sites
- Blog posts and articles
- Static content pages

**Problematic URLs:**
- Pages requiring authentication
- JavaScript-heavy applications (SPAs)
- Paywalled content
- Dynamically loaded content
- Interactive applications

<Note>
URL scraping works best with simple, text-based web pages. Complex web applications may not scrape successfully.
</Note>

### Common URL Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scraping failed" icon="circle-xmark">
    **Causes:**
    - Page requires login/authentication
    - URL is incorrect or broken
    - Content loads via JavaScript
    - Website blocks scraping (robots.txt)
    - Page doesn't exist (404)

    **Solutions:**
    - Verify URL is publicly accessible
    - Test URL in incognito browser window
    - Check URL is complete and correct
    - Copy content manually into text item
    - Use PDF export of page instead
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Content incomplete or wrong" icon="puzzle-piece">
    **Causes:**
    - JavaScript-rendered content not captured
    - Dynamic content loading
    - Multiple tabs/sections on page
    - Comments or sidebar scraped instead of main content

    **Solutions:**
    - Inspect scraped content in edit mode
    - Use direct URL to specific content
    - Copy desired content into text item
    - Export page as PDF and upload instead
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Content becomes outdated" icon="calendar">
    **Solution:**
    URL content is scraped once at creation time. To update:
    - Delete and re-create the URL item
    - Or copy current content into a text item for manual updates

    For frequently changing content, consider:
    - Manual text items you update regularly
    - PDF exports you refresh periodically
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### URL Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Test accessibility" icon="unlock">
    - Open URL in incognito window

## Processing Status Flow

Knowledge items go through two separate processing pipelines:

1. **Content Processing** - Extracting text from files/URLs
2. **Vector Indexing** - Preparing content for RAG (semantic search)

### Content Processing Status

This tracks the extraction of text content from your source.

<Steps>
  <Step title="PENDING">
    **Meaning:** Item created, queued for content extraction

    **What's happening:**
    - Item has been saved to database
    - Waiting for processing worker to pick it up
    - Usually very brief (seconds)

    **Action needed:** None - wait for processing to begin
  </Step>

  <Step title="PROCESSING">
    **Meaning:** Item content is being extracted right now

    **What's happening:**
    - For FILES: Extracting text from PDF, Word, etc.
    - For URLs: Fetching and scraping the specific web page
    - For TEXT: N/A (skips directly to COMPLETED)

    **Action needed:** Wait for processing to complete
  </Step>

  <Step title="COMPLETED">
    **Meaning:** Content extraction finished successfully

    **What's happening:**
    - Content has been extracted and stored
    - Vector indexing will begin automatically
    - Item will be available once indexing completes

    **Action needed:** None - wait for vector indexing
  </Step>

  <Step title="FAILED">
    **Meaning:** Content extraction encountered an error

    **What's happening:**
    - File extraction failed (corrupted PDF, unsupported format)
    - URL scraping failed (page not found, blocked, requires auth)
    - Content is not available to agents

    **Action needed:** Check error message and fix the issue
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Content Processing Flow:**
CREATED → PENDING → PROCESSING → COMPLETED or FAILED

---

### Vector Indexing Status

After content is extracted, it must be indexed for RAG (semantic search). This allows agents to find relevant knowledge based on meaning, not just keywords.

<Steps>
  <Step title="PENDING">
    **Meaning:** Waiting for vector indexing to start

    **What's happening:**
    - Content processing completed successfully
    - Queued for embedding generation
    - Usually brief (seconds to minutes)

    **Action needed:** None
  </Step>

  <Step title="INDEXING">
    **Meaning:** Creating vector embeddings for RAG

    **What's happening:**
    - Content is being split into chunks
    - AI embeddings being generated for each chunk
    - Vectors being stored in the knowledge base

    **Action needed:** Wait - this can take several minutes for large documents
  </Step>

  <Step title="INDEXED">
    **Meaning:** Item is fully ready for RAG retrieval

    **What's happening:**
    - Vector embeddings stored successfully
    - Item can be retrieved via semantic search
    - Agents can now use this knowledge

    **Action needed:** None - item is fully ready
  </Step>

  <Step title="FAILED">
    **Meaning:** Vector indexing failed

    **What's happening:**
    - Embedding generation encountered an error
    - Item won't appear in RAG results
    - May be available for context injection only

    **Action needed:** Try re-indexing or contact support
  </Step>

  <Step title="REMOVED">
    **Meaning:** Vectors were deleted

    **What's happening:**
    - Item was deleted or explicitly removed from index
    - No longer available for RAG

    **Action needed:** Re-index if needed
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Vector Indexing Flow:**
PENDING → INDEXING → INDEXED or FAILED

<Note>
**Both statuses must succeed for full functionality:**
- Content Status: COMPLETED
- Vector Status: INDEXED

Only then can the item be used in both context injection and RAG retrieval.
</Note>

---

## Error Handling

### When Items Fail

If a knowledge item shows FAILED status:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check the error message">
    Click on the failed item to see error details.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Identify the cause">
    Common causes:
    - **Files:** File too large, corrupted, password-protected, scanned image
    - **URL:** Authentication required, broken link, content not accessible
  </Step>

  <Step title="Try solutions">
    - **For Files:** Compress, remove protection, add text layer, or convert to text
    - **For URLs:** Verify accessibility, try different URL, or copy content to text item
  </Step>

  <Step title="Recreate or convert">
    - Delete failed item
    - Create new item with fixes applied
    - Or convert to text item by copying content manually
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Preventing Errors

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="File Prevention" icon="file-pdf">
    - Keep files under 5MB
    - Use text-based documents or quality scans
    - Remove passwords
    - Test with small file first
  </Card>
  <Card title="URL Prevention" icon="link">
    - Test URL in incognito mode
    - Use simple HTML pages
    - Avoid authenticated content
    - Check robots.txt compatibility
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

---

## Monitoring Processing

### Dashboard Indicators

In your knowledge base dashboard, you can see processing status at a glance for each item in your folders:

**Status indicators:**
- Green checkmark = COMPLETED
- Hourglass = PROCESSING
- Pause symbol = PENDING
- Red X = FAILED

**Example folder view:**
- User Manual.pdf - COMPLETED
- Quick Start Guide.pdf - PROCESSING
- API Documentation - PENDING
- Legacy Manual.pdf - FAILED

### Bulk Processing

When uploading multiple items:

1. Items process sequentially or in parallel (system-dependent)
2. Check back after 5-10 minutes for large batches
3. Review status of each item
4. Fix any failures individually

<Tip>
Upload a test item first to verify format and processing before bulk uploading.
</Tip>

---

## Choosing the Right Content Type

Use this decision tree to select the best content type:

**Do you have existing content?**
- No → Use TEXT (write directly)
- Yes, it's a document →
  - Under 10MB → Use FILE
  - Over 10MB → Extract text, use TEXT
- Yes, it's a web page →
  - Publicly accessible → Use URL (if scraping fails, copy to TEXT)
  - Not accessible → Copy content to TEXT

### Quick Recommendations

| Your Situation | Best Content Type |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Writing FAQs from scratch | TEXT |
| Have existing Word/PDF docs | Upload as FILE |
| Have documents under 10MB | FILE |
| Have documents over 10MB | Split into smaller files or extract to TEXT |
| Public web documentation | URL (with TEXT as backup) |
| Private/authenticated content | Copy to TEXT |
| Need immediate availability | TEXT (no processing delay) |
| Complex formatting matters | FILE |
