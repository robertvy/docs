## Overview

After creating your knowledge base, the next step is connecting it to your agents. You control exactly what knowledge each agent can access—from entire knowledge bases down to individual items.

This flexibility allows you to:
- Give different agents access to different information
- Ensure agents only reference relevant, approved content
- Update agent knowledge without changing agent configuration

---

## Assignment Levels

You can assign knowledge to agents at three different levels of granularity:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Entire Knowledge Base" icon="database">
    Agent has access to all folders and items within the knowledge base.

    **Best for:** Agents that need comprehensive access to all information in a category.

    **Example:** Customer support agent with access to entire "Support Resources" knowledge base.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Specific Folder" icon="folder">
    Agent only accesses one folder within a knowledge base.

    **Best for:** Specialized agents that only need information from one category.

    **Example:** Billing agent with access only to "Billing & Payments" folder.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Individual Items" icon="file">
    Agent has access to specific knowledge items only.

    **Best for:** Agents that need very specific, controlled information.

    **Example:** Appointment agent with access only to "Cancellation Policy" and "Scheduling Guidelines" items.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How to Assign Knowledge

### Step 1: Navigate to Agent Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your agent">
    Go to **Agents** in the left sidebar and select the agent you want to configure.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go to Abilities → Knowledge">
    Click on **Abilities** in the left navigation, then select the **Knowledge** section.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Add Knowledge

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Add Knowledge'">
    Click the **+ Add Knowledge** button to open the knowledge selector.

<Frame>
  <div className="block dark:hidden">
    <img src="/images/knowledge/knowledge-light.png" alt="Add Knowledge dialog showing knowledge selection options (Entire Base, Folder, Specific Item) and access method configuration (RAG vs Context Mode)" />
  </div>
  <div className="hidden dark:block">
    <img src="/images/knowledge/knowledge-dark.png" alt="Add Knowledge dialog showing knowledge selection options (Entire Base, Folder, Specific Item) and access method configuration (RAG vs Context Mode)" />
  </div>
</Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose assignment level">
    Select what you want to assign:
    - **Knowledge Base** - Entire knowledge base
    - **Folder** - Specific folder within a base
    - **Item** - Individual knowledge item
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select the knowledge">
    Browse or search to find the knowledge base, folder, or item you want to assign.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose access mode">
    Select how the agent should access this knowledge:
    - **Context Mode** - Inject all knowledge into the system prompt (limited to 10k tokens overall)
    - **RAG Mode** - Dynamically retrieve relevant knowledge based on conversation

  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Add** to assign the knowledge to your agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Agent Knowledge

### View Assigned Knowledge

In the agent's Knowledge section, you'll see all assigned knowledge bases, folders, and items with their access modes.

### Modify Assignment

- **Change access mode:** Remove the knowledge and re-add it with the desired mode (Context or RAG)
- **Remove knowledge:** Click the remove icon to unlink knowledge from the agent
- **Add more:** Click **+ Add Knowledge** to assign additional knowledge

### Test Knowledge Access

After assigning knowledge:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Make a test call">
    Use the **Test** feature to call your agent.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ask knowledge-based questions">
    Ask questions that should be answered using the assigned knowledge.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify responses">
    Confirm the agent is accessing and using the knowledge correctly.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust if needed">
    If responses aren't accurate, check:
    - Is the right knowledge assigned?
    - Is the access mode appropriate (Context vs RAG)?
    - Is the knowledge content accurate and up-to-date?
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

### Start Small, Then Expand

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Begin with essential knowledge" icon="circle-1">
    Start by assigning only the most critical knowledge your agent needs.

    **Example:**
    - Start: Return policy, business hours, contact info (3 items)
    - Later: Add product details, FAQs, troubleshooting (20+ items)

    **Why:** Easier to verify accuracy and troubleshoot issues with less knowledge.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test thoroughly after each addition" icon="circle-2">
    Every time you add knowledge, test to ensure the agent uses it correctly.

    **Test checklist:**
    - Ask direct questions about the new knowledge
    - Ask edge cases or tricky scenarios
    - Verify agent doesn't hallucinate or make up information
    - Confirm agent correctly says "I don't know" when knowledge doesn't cover a topic
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor and refine" icon="circle-3">
    After deployment, monitor real conversations to see how knowledge is being used.

    **Look for:**
    - Questions the agent couldn't answer (missing knowledge)
    - Incorrect answers (knowledge needs updating)
    - Confused responses (too much similar knowledge)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Choose the Right Assignment Level

- **Entire Knowledge Base** - When agent needs everything in a category
- **Specific Folder** - When agent has a specialized role
- **Individual Items** - When you need precise control over what agent knows

<Warning>
Avoid assigning overlapping knowledge at different levels. For example, don't assign both "Customer Support KB" (entire base) AND "Returns Folder" (from the same base). This creates redundancy.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent isn't using assigned knowledge" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Check:**
    1. Is the knowledge actually assigned to the agent?
    2. Is the vector indexing status "INDEXED"? (Check in Knowledge Base > Items)
    3. Is the access mode appropriate? (Try switching Context/RAG)
    4. Is the question phrased in a way the knowledge can answer?

    **Test:** Ask a very direct question that's clearly in the knowledge. If agent still doesn't use it, there's a configuration issue.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent gives incorrect information" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Check:**
    1. Is the knowledge content itself accurate?
    2. Are there conflicting items in the knowledge base?
    3. Is outdated knowledge still assigned?

    **Fix:**
    - Review and update the knowledge content, remove conflicting/outdated items
    - **Lower the temperature setting** (in AI Model settings) to make the agent stick closer to the knowledge
    - **Add critical knowledge to Context Mode** instead of RAG for guaranteed inclusion in every conversation
    - **Switch to a more capable model** in AI Model settings (e.g., GPT-4.1 instead of GPT-4.1 Mini, or Claude Sonnet instead of Haiku)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agent says 'I don't know' but knowledge exists" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Possible causes:**
    1. Knowledge isn't indexed yet (check vector status)
    2. RAG mode can't find relevant matches (try Context mode)
    3. Knowledge title/content doesn't match the question keywords

    **Fix:**
    - Wait for indexing to complete
    - Improve knowledge item titles and content to include common question keywords
    - Consider using Context mode for critical information
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
