## Overview

Recording Opt-Out enables callers to request that their call recording be stopped and deleted during the conversation. This feature helps with GDPR compliance and demonstrates respect for caller privacy.

<Note>
When enabled, this feature adds a tool your AI agent can invoke when a caller expresses they don't want to be recorded.
</Note>

---

## How It Works

When a caller says something like "I don't want to be recorded" or "Please stop recording":

1. **Agent recognizes the request:** The AI understands the opt-out request
2. **Tool is invoked:** The recording opt-out action is triggered
3. **Recording stops:** Live recording is halted immediately
4. **Data deleted:** Any recorded audio for this call is deleted
5. **Caller confirmed:** Agent confirms the action to the caller

---

## Configuration

Navigate to your agent's **Privacy Settings** section.

### Enable Recording Opt-Out

Toggle the feature on or off:

- **Enabled:** Callers can request to stop and delete recording
- **Disabled:** Opt-out requests are not available (default)

---

## Caller Triggers

The agent will recognize opt-out requests phrased in various ways:

**English:**
- "Stop recording this call"
- "I don't want to be recorded"
- "Please don't record me"
- "Turn off the recording"
- "Delete this recording"

**German:**
- "Bitte nicht aufnehmen"
- "Aufnahme stoppen"
- "Ich möchte nicht aufgenommen werden"

The agent uses natural language understanding to recognize intent, not just exact phrases.

## What Happens When Opt-Out is Triggered

| Component | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Live recording | Stopped immediately |
| Recorded audio | Permanently deleted |
| Transcript | Deleted (if recording-linked) |
| Call metadata | Retained (call happened, duration, etc.) |
| Analytics | Basic call stats retained |

<Warning>
Once recording is deleted, it cannot be recovered. Ensure your team understands this is a permanent action.

## Best Practices

**Combine with announcements:** If you record calls, inform callers at the start with a Privacy Announcement. Mention the opt-out option:

```text
This call may be recorded for quality purposes. If you prefer not to be
recorded, please let me know at any time.
```

**Train your agent:** Add instructions to acknowledge opt-out requests professionally:

```text
When a caller requests to stop recording:
- Acknowledge the request immediately
- Confirm the recording has been stopped and deleted
- Reassure them the conversation can continue
- Do not pressure them to continue recording
```

**Document your policy:** Have a clear internal policy about what happens when callers opt out and how this affects quality assurance processes.

## GDPR Considerations

Under GDPR, individuals have the right to:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Be informed">
    Know that recording is taking place (use announcements)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Give consent">
    Agree to being recorded before it happens
  </Step>
  <Step title="Withdraw consent">
    Change their mind and request recording to stop
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request deletion">
    Have recorded data removed (right to erasure)
  </Step>
</Steps>

Recording Opt-Out addresses the last two rights—allowing callers to withdraw consent and request deletion during the call.

<Warning>
This is general guidance, not legal advice. Consult with a legal professional to ensure your recording practices meet your specific regulatory requirements.
</Warning>

---

## Limitations

- **Only affects current call:** Cannot delete recordings from previous calls
- **Immediate effect:** Once triggered, cannot be undone during the same call
- **Metadata retained:** Basic call information (that a call occurred) is retained
- **Not retroactive:** Only applies from the point of request forward
