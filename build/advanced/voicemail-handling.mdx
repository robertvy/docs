## Overview

Answering Machine Detection (AMD) enables your AI agents to automatically detect when outbound calls reach voicemail instead of a live person. When voicemail is detected, the agent hangs up and logs the outcome, allowing you to retry at different times to maximize chances of reaching a live person.

This critical feature prevents wasted agent time talking to answering machines and optimizes campaign efficiency by focusing resources on live conversations rather than voicemail systems.

<Note>
**Phone Calls Only:** AMD applies to phone calls via SIP/PSTN connections. Web-based conversations without a phone leg do not support DTMF interaction.

AMD configuration is accessed during campaign creation and test calls. Text-Based AMD is always active. You can optionally enable ML-Based AMD as an addon for faster detection (~1.5s vs 5-15s).
</Note>

## What is Answering Machine Detection?

### The Challenge

When making outbound calls, you encounter two possible scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Live Answer**
```text wrap
Phone rings → Person answers → "Hello?"
→ Agent should engage in conversation
→ Full agent capabilities needed
```

**Scenario 2: Voicemail**
```text wrap
Phone rings → Voicemail system answers → "You've reached John Smith..."
→ Agent should hang up and retry later
→ Don't waste time with full conversation script
→ Don't create awkward interaction talking over voicemail greeting
```

**The problem:** How does the agent know which scenario occurred?

### AMD Solution

AMD analyzes the audio in the first few seconds after call connection to determine if a human or machine answered:

**Detection process:**
```text wrap
1. Call connects
2. AMD analyzes audio (0.5-3 seconds depending on method)
3. Classification: HUMAN or MACHINE
4. Agent executes appropriate behavior
```

**Benefits:**
- **Efficiency:** Don't waste agent time on voicemail
- **Better targeting:** Focus retry attempts on different times to reach live person
- **Higher connect rates:** Optimize call timing based on voicemail patterns
- **Better analytics:** Separate "reached voicemail" from "no answer" in reporting

## AMD Methods

### Overview of Detection Types

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Text-Based AMD" icon="text">
    Keyword-based detection using transcriber and LLM - always active
  </Card>
  <Card title="ML-Based AMD (Optional)" icon="brain">
    Fast pattern recognition using Deep Neural Network - optional addon for speed
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Text-Based AMD

**Role:** Base detection layer that always runs. Uses your agent's transcriber and LLM to identify voicemail keywords.

**How it works:**
```text wrap
1. Call connects
2. Agent's AI voice pipeline (transcriber) receives audio
3. Agent waits for first turn/utterance to complete (pause detected)
4. LLM analyzes transcription for voicemail-like patterns:
   - "You've reached"
   - "Leave a message"
   - "Not available"
   - "Voicemail"
   - "After the beep"
5. If voicemail detected → Agent hangs up
6. If live person detected → Agent continues normal conversation
```

**Characteristics:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Speed" icon="gauge">
    **Slower:** Waits for complete turn/utterance to finish

    Must wait for the entire voicemail greeting to complete (pause detected), then transcribe and analyze the full text. Typical detection occurs after 5-15+ seconds depending on length of voicemail message.

    **Limitation:** Long voicemail greetings mean longer wait times before detection

    **Best for:** Campaigns where accuracy is more important than immediate detection
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Accuracy" icon="chart-line">
    **High accuracy when:**
    - Standard voicemail greetings with common phrases
    - Clear audio quality
    - Voicemail language matches transcriber language
    - B2B environments with professional greetings

    **Will NOT detect:**
    - Voicemail greetings in languages the transcriber doesn't support
    - Voicemail systems with no greeting (just beeps)
    - Non-verbal voicemail indicators

    **Lower accuracy when:**
    - Custom greetings without standard keywords
    - Short greetings ("Hi, leave a message" - very brief)
    - Poor audio quality or background noise
    - Background noise interfering with transcription
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Best Use Cases" icon="briefcase">
    **Ideal for:**
    - **B2B campaigns** - Business voicemails typically use standard phrasing
    - **Campaigns prioritizing accuracy** - Reduces false positives by analyzing full utterance context
    - **Budget-conscious deployments** - Lower computational cost
    - **English-language markets** - Keyword detection optimized for English

    **Example scenarios:**
    - Sales outreach to business phone numbers
    - Appointment reminders to office lines
    - B2B lead qualification campaigns
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Limitations" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **May struggle with:**
    - Personal, creative voicemail greetings ("Hey, it's Mike, you know what to do")
    - Very short greetings
    - Voicemail language doesn't match transcriber language
    - Greetings that sound conversational ("Hello? Hello? Just kidding, leave a message")
    - Background music or noise in greeting

    **False positives:** Human who starts with "You've reached..." might be misclassified

    **False negatives:** Voicemail without keywords might be classified as human
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### ML-Based AMD (Optional Addon)

**Role:** Optional fast detection layer you can enable for speed. Works in parallel with text-based AMD.

**How it works:**
```text wrap
1. Call connects
2. Deep Neural Network (DNN) analyzes audio in real-time:
   - Speech patterns and cadence
   - Voicemail audio patterns
   - Acoustic characteristics
   - Timing and rhythm
   - Natural vs. recorded speech indicators
3. Model trained on tens of thousands of audio recordings
4. Classification: HUMAN or MACHINE
5. Language-independent detection
```

**Characteristics:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Speed" icon="gauge-high">
    **Fast:** ~1.5 seconds

    Identifies live human responses within 1.5 seconds

    **Much faster than text-based AMD** which must wait for complete utterance
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Accuracy" icon="chart-line">
    **Very high accuracy** in real-world conditions

    **Why enable ML-Based AMD:**
    - **Language-independent:** Works across all languages (text-based only works if transcriber language matches)
    - **Detects beep-only voicemail:** Catches voicemail systems with no greeting (text-based cannot)
    - **Handles creative greetings:** Detects personal/non-standard greetings without keywords
    - **Pattern-based detection:** Doesn't rely on specific voicemail keywords
    - **Fast detection:** ~1.5 seconds vs 5-15+ seconds for text-only
    - **Better for multi-language campaigns:** No language configuration needed

    **Limitations:**
    - Extremely short connections (< 0.5 seconds of audio)
    - Highly degraded audio quality
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Best Use Cases" icon="briefcase">
    **Ideal for:**
    - **Consumer campaigns** - Personal voicemails with creative greetings
    - **Multi-language campaigns** - Not dependent on English keywords
    - **Quality-focused campaigns** - When accuracy is more important than speed
    - **Complex markets** - Mixed business/personal numbers

    **Example scenarios:**
    - Consumer sales calls
    - Political campaigns
    - Non-profit fundraising
    - Healthcare outreach
    - Multi-language support campaigns
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Advantages" icon="check">
    **Handles well:**
    - Creative personal greetings
    - Short greetings
    - Non-English voicemails
    - Greetings without standard keywords
    - Background music or sound effects
    - Natural conversational-sounding greetings

    **Robust across:**
    - Different languages
    - Regional accents
    - Various voicemail systems
    - Custom greetings
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### How AMD Works

**Text-Based AMD (Base Layer):**
- Always active
- Analyzes transcription for voicemail keywords
- Waits for complete utterance (5-15+ seconds)
- More conservative - rarely hangs up on live people

**ML-Based AMD (Optional Addon):**
- You can optionally enable this for faster detection
- Analyzes audio patterns in ~1.5 seconds
- Works in parallel with text-based AMD
- Faster but may occasionally hang up on live people

**Configuration Options:**

**Text-Based Only (Conservative):**
- Only text-based detection active
- Slower detection (5-15+ seconds)
- Rarely hangs up on live people
- **Trade-off:** Might miss some voicemails and talk to them
- Best for: When you want to avoid hanging up on live people at all cost

**Text-Based + ML-Based (Fast & Recommended):**
- ML detects in ~1.5 seconds
- Text-based validates in parallel
- Very high accuracy
- **Trade-off:** Occasionally might hang up on a live person
- Best for: Campaigns where talking to voicemail incurs additional cost

<Tip>
**Which should you choose?**

**Text-Based + ML-Based (recommended):** If talking to voicemail wastes time and incurs additional cost, and you can tolerate occasionally hanging up on a live person.

**Text-Based Only:** If hanging up on a real person in rare occurrences is worse than the additional cost of talking to voicemail.
</Tip>

## AMD Behavior

When AMD detects voicemail, the agent automatically hangs up and logs the outcome.

The call is marked as **MACHINE** in campaign analytics, allowing you to schedule retries at different times to increase chances of reaching a live person.

## Testing AMD Configuration

### AMD Test Plan

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test ML-Based AMD">
    **Setup:**
    1. Configure agent with ML-Based AMD enabled
    2. Prepare test phone number with voicemail

    **Test:**
    1. Start test call to voicemail number
    2. Let call go to voicemail
    3. Monitor agent behavior

    **Validation:**
    - Agent hangs up within ~1.5 seconds
    - Call marked as MACHINE in logs
    - No conversation attempt with voicemail greeting
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Text-Based AMD">
    **Setup:**
    1. Configure agent with Text-Based AMD only
    2. Use same voicemail test number

    **Test:**
    1. Start test call
    2. Let call go to voicemail with standard greeting

    **Validation:**
    - Agent waits for complete greeting (5-15+ seconds)
    - Agent hangs up after detecting keywords
    - Call marked as MACHINE
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Live Person Detection">
    **Setup:**
    1. Test with both AMD methods
    2. Answer call personally

    **Test:**
    1. Start test call
    2. Answer and say "Hello?"
    3. Verify agent continues conversation normally

    **Validation:**
    - Agent does NOT hang up
    - Normal conversation proceeds
    - Call NOT marked as MACHINE
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Edge Cases">
    **Scenarios to test:**

    **Silent answer:**
    - Answer but don't speak
    - Verify AMD doesn't misclassify

    **Quick greeting:**
    - Answer with very brief "Hi"
    - Verify conversation continues

    **Voicemail without keywords:**
    - Test with non-standard greeting
    - Monitor ML vs text-based performance

    **Beep-only voicemail:**
    - Voicemail system with no greeting
    - Verify ML-based detects, text-based may miss
  </Step>
</Steps>
