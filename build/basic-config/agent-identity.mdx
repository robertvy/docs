## Overview

Your agent's identity includes the basic information that helps you and your team identify, organize, and manage agents in your dashboard. Some details like name and avatar are also visible in demo links.

  </div>

## Agent Name

The agent name helps you identify this agent in your dashboard, campaigns, and reports.

<Warning>
The agent name is visible to visitors in demo links. For customer-facing names, use a professional name like "Acme Support" or "Sarah from Acme Sales" rather than internal labels like "Lead Qualifier v2".
</Warning>

### Best Practices

**For customer-facing agents (visible in demos):**
- "Acme Support"
- "Alex from Acme Sales"
- "Booking Assistant"

**For internal organization (multiple agents):**
- "Customer Support - Product Questions"
- "Outbound Sales - Lead Qualification"
- "Appointment Booking - Dental Clinic"

**Avoid:**
- "Agent 1"
- "Test"
- "New Agent"

**Use Consistent Naming**
Develop a naming convention:
- `[Function] - [Specialty]`
- `[Department] - [Agent Type]`
- `[Use Case] - [Language]`

## Avatar

Upload an avatar image to visually identify your agent in the dashboard and in demo links you share with others.

<Frame>
  <div className="block dark:hidden">

  </div>
  <div className="hidden dark:block">

The avatar is visible when you share demo links, so choose an image that represents your brand professionally.

## Tags

Tags help organize and filter agents in your dashboard, especially useful when managing many agents.

<Frame>
  <div className="block dark:hidden">
    <img src="/images/agent/tags-light.png" alt="Tags input field with label 'Enter tags to categorize and filter agents' and placeholder text 'Type tag and press enter'" />
  </div>
  <div className="hidden dark:block">
    <img src="/images/agent/tags-dark.png" alt="Tags input field with label 'Enter tags to categorize and filter agents' and placeholder text 'Type tag and press enter'" />
  </div>
</Frame>

### Tagging Strategies
