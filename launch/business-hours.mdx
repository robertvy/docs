## Overview

Business hours control when outbound campaigns can place calls, ensuring calls only happen during appropriate times.

Key benefits:
- **Compliance**: Meet legal requirements like TCPA (8am-9pm local time in the U.S.)
- **Customer experience**: Avoid calling during inconvenient hours
- **Cost optimization**: Focus calling during high-answer-rate windows
- **Timezone management**: Respect local time across regions

## How Business Hours Work

Business hours are configured separately and then assigned to campaigns. This allows you to:
- Reuse the same business hours across multiple campaigns
- Manage schedules centrally (e.g., "DACH Business Hours", "24/7 Support")
- Configure holiday closures once for all campaigns

  <Step title="Set weekly schedule">
    For each day of the week:
    - Toggle day active/inactive
    - Set start and end times (default: 09:00-17:00)

### Assigning to Campaigns

When creating or editing a campaign:
1. Find the **Business Hours** field
2. Select from your configured business hours
3. Leave empty for 24/7 operation

The campaign will only place calls during the configured hours in the selected timezone.

### DACH Business Hours Examples

<Accordion title="Common DACH Configurations">
  **Standard Office Hours (Germany/Austria/Switzerland)**
  - **Mon-Fri 9:00-17:00**: Conservative, compliant with all regulations
  - **Mon-Fri 8:00-18:00**: Extended for better reach
  - **Mon-Thu 8:00-20:00, Fri 8:00-18:00**: Maximum legal window in Germany

  **With Date Overrides (German Public Holidays)**
  Common recurring closures:
  - New Year's Day (Jan 1)
  - Good Friday, Easter Monday
  - Labor Day (May 1)
  - German Unity Day (Oct 3)
  - Christmas (Dec 25-26)

  Configure these as **recurring** date overrides marked as **closed**.
</Accordion>

### Holiday and Special Schedules

For campaigns that run over weeks or months:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add date overrides">
    Configure holiday closures in your business hours:
    - Add date override for each holiday
    - Mark as **Recurring** to repeat annually
    - Set **Is Closed** to block calls on those dates
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pause for unplanned events">
    For ad-hoc closures, navigate to active campaign → **Pause Campaign**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust hours mid-campaign">
    To modify calling hours:
    1. Edit the assigned business hours (affects all campaigns using it)
    2. Or create new business hours and reassign to campaign
    3. Changes apply immediately to queued calls
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

### Answer Rate Optimization

The campaign dashboard provides a weekly heatmap showing answer rates for every hour, making it easy to identify the best times to call.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review the heatmap">
    After your first 50-100 calls, check the campaign dashboard's answer rate heatmap to see which hours perform best.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust business hours">
    Update your business hours configuration to focus on high-performing time windows shown in the heatmap.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor voicemail patterns">
    If AMD shows high voicemail rates (>60%) during certain hours, avoid those times—it signals people are busy/unavailable.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Compliance & Legal Requirements
