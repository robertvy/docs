Once your agent is live, a few simple habits will keep it running smoothly and delivering good results.

## Monitor Performance

Check in regularly to catch issues early:

**Review Conversations**: Listen to a few calls each week in **Conversations**. Check that your agent is handling calls as expected and look for patterns in failures or transfers.

**Check the Dashboard**: Review call volume and success rates in campaign **Dashboard**. Watch for sudden drops in answer rates or goal achievement. Use the answer rate heat map to optimize calling hours.

## Keep Things Current

Your agent performs best with up-to-date information:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Update knowledge regularly">
    When your product, pricing, or policies change, update your agent's knowledge base immediately so it gives accurate information.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Refine instructions as needed">
    If you notice your agent struggling with certain scenarios, update the instructions to handle them better. Test changes before deploying.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and adjust business hours">
    Use campaign analytics to find the best calling times, then update your business hours configuration to focus on high-performing windows.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Handle Issues Quickly

When something goes wrong:

1. **Check recent changes**: Did you update instructions, knowledge, or integrations recently?
2. **Review error logs**: Look in **Conversations** for failed calls and error messages
3. **Test the flow**: Use the web test to reproduce the issue
4. **Fix and verify**: Make the correction, then test again before considering it resolved
