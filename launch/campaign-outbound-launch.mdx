Outbound campaigns automate high-volume calling for sales, reminders, surveys, and notifications. Each campaign connects your agent to a contact list, manages dialing schedules, and tracks outcomes.

## Contact Lifecycle

Contacts progress through these statuses, shown with colored badges and icons throughout the UI:

### Active States

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Pending" icon="clock">
    **Gray badge with clock icon**

    Contact is queued and waiting to be dialed
  </Card>

  <Card title="Dialing" icon="phone">
    **Yellow badge with phone icon**

    Call is currently in progress - dialing the contact
  </Card>

  <Card title="Called" icon="phone">
    **Violet badge**

    Call has been made, awaiting next step
  </Card>

  <Card title="Retry" icon="arrows-rotate">
    **Blue badge with refresh icon**

    No meaningful conversation occurred, call scheduled for retry

</Note>

## Managing Active Campaigns

### Changing Campaign Status

Navigate to **Campaigns** list and click the status badge to change:

- **Active**: Campaign is actively dialing contacts
- **Paused**: Stop dialing temporarily while preserving all progress
- **Completed**: Mark campaign as finished
- **Cancelled**: Cancel the campaign

### Adding Contacts Mid-Campaign

You can add more contacts to a running campaign:
1. Go to **Contacts** tab
2. Use the two-panel interface to add new contacts
3. New contacts enter the queue automatically

### Updating Settings

Modify campaign settings at any time:
- Update **Business Hours** to adjust calling windows
- Change **Retry Logic** based on performance
- Modify **Call Interval** or **Ring Timeout**
- Changes apply immediately to queued calls

    Large exports are processed in the background so you can keep managing your campaign. Each export shows its format icon (Excel or CSV) for quick identification.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Inbound Call Integration

When contacts call back, the system automatically links the call to the campaign contact using a two-tier matching strategy:

### Matching Logic

**Primary Match (DID-based)**:
- Matches contact's phone number (calling number) with campaign's phone number (called number)
- Works for active or paused campaigns
- Most reliable method - doesn't require agent match

**Fallback Match (Agent-based)**:
- Only activates if:
  - No DID match found, AND
  - Contact has a recent outbound call (within 30 days) from any campaign
- Matches contact's phone number with campaigns using the same agent
- Uses most recently updated campaign contact

### Status Updates

When an inbound call is matched to a campaign contact in these statuses, it automatically updates to **Called**:
- Retry → Called
- Completed → Called
- No Conversation → Called

This allows callbacks to reopen contact opportunities and continue the campaign workflow.

### Benefits

- **Automatic Linking**: No manual intervention needed
- **Context Continuity**: Agent has access to all previous campaign interactions
- **Status Updates**: Contact lifecycle automatically adjusts for callbacks
- **Unified Reporting**: All interactions (outbound + inbound) tracked together per contact

## Best Practices

### Start Small

<Warning>
Always start with a pilot batch of 10-20 contacts before scaling to thousands. This validates configuration and prevents large-scale mistakes.
</Warning>

**Pilot workflow**:
1. Create a test list with friendly contacts (colleagues, test numbers)
2. Launch the campaign and monitor in **Conversations → Live monitor**
3. Review outcomes:
   - Answer rate
   - AMD accuracy
   - Goal achievement rate
   - Average call duration
4. Adjust agent instructions, AMD settings, or business hours as needed
5. Scale gradually: 50 → 200 → 1,000+ contacts

### Contact List Quality

Before uploading contacts:
- Remove duplicate numbers
- Validate phone number format (E.164: +1234567890)
- Check against your internal Do Not Call list
- Verify against national DNC registries if applicable

### Timezone Optimization

For contacts across multiple time zones:
1. Create business hours in **Settings → Business Hours** with appropriate timezone
2. Assign to campaign so calls happen during local business hours
3. Use the answer rate heat map to find optimal calling windows per region

### Segmentation

Create separate campaigns for:
- Different customer segments (trial vs. paid customers)
- Different scripts or objectives
- Different languages
- A/B testing variations

This allows you to track performance and optimize each segment independently.
