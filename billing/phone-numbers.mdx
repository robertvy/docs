## Best Practices

  <Accordion title="Use local numbers for local presence" icon="location-dot">
    Calls from local numbers have higher answer rates. Use numbers that match your target audience's region.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider toll-free for inbound support" icon="phone-volume">
    Toll-free numbers encourage customers to call since they won't be charged. Great for support lines.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Release unused numbers" icon="trash">
    Don't pay for numbers you're not using. Review and release inactive numbers monthly.
