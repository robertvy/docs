## How Usage Billing Works

After you've used your plan's included minutes, additional usage is billed per minute based on your **Usage Tier**.

<Note>
Your Usage Tier is determined by the AI providers you configure for your agent (transcription, voice, and language model).
</Note>

---

## Usage Tiers

| Tier | Included Providers | Rate |
|------|-------------------|------|
| **Essential** | Deepgram + Azure TTS + GPT-4.1 Mini | **€0.10/min** |
| **Standard** | Deepgram + Cartesia + Claude Haiku | **€0.12/min** |
| **Pro** | Deepgram + ElevenLabs + Claude Haiku | **€0.13/min** |
| **Premium** | Deepgram + ElevenLabs + Claude Sonnet | **€0.15/min** |

Your tier is automatically determined by the most premium provider in your agent configuration.

## Volume Discounts

Higher usage earns automatic discounts:

| Monthly Volume | Discount | Essential | Standard | Pro | Premium |
|----------------|----------|-----------|----------|-----|---------|
| Under 5,000 min | 0% | €0.10 | €0.12 | €0.13 | €0.15 |
| 5,000 - 15,000 min | 10% | €0.09 | €0.108 | €0.117 | €0.135 |
| 15,000+ min | 20% | €0.08 | €0.096 | €0.104 | €0.12 |

<Tip>
Volume discounts apply to your entire usage for the billing period, not just minutes above the threshold.
</Tip>

## What's Included in Per-Minute Rate

Your per-minute rate covers:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Transcription (STT)** | Converting speech to text |
| **Language Model (LLM)** | AI processing and responses |
| **Voice Synthesis (TTS)** | Converting text to speech |
| **Platform Fee** | LiveKit infrastructure, routing |
| **Telephony** | Basic inbound/outbound routing |

## Billing Rules

### Minimum Duration (Dynamic Opening)

When your agent uses a dynamic opening message (AI speaks first with personalized content), a **minimum 10-second charge** applies. This accounts for the processing overhead of generating personalized greetings.

**When it applies:**
- AI speaks first is enabled
- Dynamic opening message is enabled
- Call duration < 10 seconds

**Example:** A 6-second call with dynamic opening is billed as 10 seconds.

### Token Scaling

For conversations with large prompts (instructions, knowledge base context, tool descriptions), duration is scaled based on token usage.

**Formula:**
```
If tokens > 3,500:
Billed Duration = Actual Duration × (Tokens ÷ 3,500)
```

**Example:** A 60-second call using 4,200 tokens:
- Scaling factor: 4,200 ÷ 3,500 = 1.2
- Billed duration: 60 × 1.2 = 72 seconds

<Note>
Token scaling ensures fair pricing for conversations that require more AI processing, regardless of call length.
</Note>

## Calculating Your Bill

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check included minutes">
    Your plan includes a set amount of minutes per month
  </Step>
  <Step title="Subtract included minutes">
    Overage = Total Usage - Included Minutes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply billing rules">
    Adjust for minimum duration and token scaling
  </Step>
  <Step title="Determine tier rate">
    Based on your agent's provider configuration
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply volume discount">
    If applicable based on total monthly usage
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Calculation

**Scenario:**
- Plan: Pro (2,500 minutes included)
- Total usage: 3,200 minutes
- Usage tier: Standard (€0.12/min)
- No volume discount (under 5,000 min)

**Calculation:**
```
Overage: 3,200 - 2,500 = 700 minutes
Cost: 700 × €0.12 = €84.00
```

---

## Monitoring Usage

Track your usage in real-time from **Settings > Billing > Usage**.

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Minutes Used** | Total minutes this billing period |
| **Minutes Remaining** | Included minutes left |
| **Projected Usage** | Estimated end-of-period total |
| **Cost to Date** | Overage charges so far |

### Usage Alerts

Set up alerts to notify you when:
- You've used 75% of included minutes
- You've used 100% of included minutes
- Projected usage exceeds a threshold

Configure alerts in **Settings > Notifications > Billing Alerts**.
