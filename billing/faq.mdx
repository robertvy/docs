## Usage Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How is call duration calculated?" icon="stopwatch">
    Call duration is measured from when the connection is established until the call ends. Billing is calculated per second and rounded to the nearest minute on your invoice.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why was I charged more than expected?" icon="magnifying-glass-dollar">
    Common reasons for higher-than-expected charges:

    1. **Premium providers:** Using ElevenLabs, Claude Opus, etc. adds surcharges
    2. **Token scaling:** Large prompts increase billed duration
    3. **Outbound fees:** Each outbound call attempt has a fixed fee
    4. **Phone numbers:** Monthly rental regardless of usage

    Check **Settings > Billing > Usage** for a detailed breakdown.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do test calls count toward usage?" icon="vial">
    **Web simulator:** Test calls in the web simulator are free and don't count toward usage.

    **Real phone calls:** Test calls to real phone numbers count as regular usage.

    **Demo links:** Calls through demo/share links count toward the creating team's usage.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do concurrent calls work?" icon="phone-flip">
    Your plan includes a maximum number of simultaneous calls. If you're at your limit:

    - Inbound calls go to voicemail (if configured) or receive a busy signal
    - Outbound calls are queued until a slot opens

    Monitor concurrent usage in **Settings > Billing > Usage**.
  </Accordion>
