## How Billing Works

itellicoAI uses a hybrid billing model combining **subscription plans** with **usage-based pricing**. This gives you predictable costs with the flexibility to scale.

## Billing Components

### 1. Subscription Base

Your plan includes:
- **Included minutes** — Use these before per-minute charges apply
- **Concurrent call slots** — How many simultaneous calls you can handle
- **Feature access** — Agents, knowledge bases, team members, etc.

### 2. Usage Charges

When you exceed included minutes:
- **Per-minute rate** — Based on your usage tier (Essential, Standard, Pro, Premium)
- **Volume discounts** — Lower rates at higher volumes

### 3. Additional Charges

- **Phone number rental** — Monthly fee per number
- **Outbound call fees** — Per-attempt fee for outbound calls
- **Premium providers** — Surcharges for premium AI models, voices, etc.
