## Step 2: Configure Your Agent

### Set Instructions

Define how your agent should behave:

1. Expand **Abilities** and click **Instructions**
2. Use this template as a starting point:

```
You are the professional voice of [Your Company Name].

Your objectives:
- Provide helpful, accurate information
- Resolve simple inquiries independently
- Escalate complex issues to human agents

Communication style:
- Professional yet friendly
- Keep responses under 30 seconds
- Provide clear, actionable guidance
```

### Configure Greeting

Set up the first impression:

1. Under **Abilities**, select **Greeting**
2. Choose **AI Agent Initiates with Fixed Message**
3. Enter your greeting:

```
Hello! Thank you for contacting [Company Name]. How can I help you today?
```

4. Set delay to **0.5 seconds** for natural pacing

### Select AI Model & Voice

Choose the technology powering your agent:

1. Expand **Models** and click **Model**
2. Select **Azure OpenAI** with **GPT-4.1 Mini** (recommended)
3. Click **Voice** and choose **ElevenLabs**
4. Preview voices and select one matching your brand
5. In **Transcriber**, select **Deepgram Nova-3 General** with your preferred language or multilingual

## Step 3: Test Your Agent

Before going live, test your agent:

1. Click **Test Call** (top-right corner)
2. Click **Start Web Call**

<Frame>
  <div className="block dark:hidden">
    <img src="/images/web-test/web-test-light.png" alt="Test Agent dialog showing Test Type with Web Call and Phone Call tabs, Web Call Settings section with description about browser microphone and system audio permissions, and Start Web Call button" />
  </div>

  </div>
</Frame>

3. Grant microphone permissions when prompted
4. Try different scenarios:
   - "Hello, I need help with my account"
   - "Can you tell me about your services?"
   - "I'd like to speak with someone"
5. Evaluate responses for clarity and tone

<Note>
If responses seem off, adjust your instructions and test again. Iteration is key to a great agent.
