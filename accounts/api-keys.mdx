## Overview

API keys provide programmatic access to the itellicoAI platform, allowing you to integrate agents into your applications, automate tasks, and build custom workflows.

## What are API Keys?

API keys are secure tokens that authenticate your API requests without requiring user login credentials.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Account-scoped**: Each key belongs to a specific account
- **Secret**: Treat like a password - never share or commit to version control
- **Revocable**: Can be disabled or deleted at any time
- **Trackable**: Monitor last used timestamp and activity

## Creating API Keys

### How to Create

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to API Keys">
    Go to **Settings → API Keys** in your account
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Create API Key">
    Click the **Create API Key** button

<Frame>
  <div className="block dark:hidden">
    <img src="/images/keys/create-key-light.png" alt="Create API Key dialog with key name and expiration date fields" />
  </div>
  <div className="hidden dark:block">
    <img src="/images/keys/create-key-dark.png" alt="Create API Key dialog with key name and expiration date fields" />
  </div>
</Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter a Label">
    Give your key a descriptive name:
    - "Production Server"
    - "Development Environment"
    - "CI/CD Pipeline"
    - "Mobile App - iOS"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Expiration (Optional)">
    Optionally set an expiration date for automatic key rotation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy the Key">
    **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: The full key is shown only once!

    Copy it immediately and store securely.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Store Securely">
    Save the key in:
    - Environment variables
    - Secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
    - Password manager

    **Never** commit to git or share publicly!
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
The full API key is displayed **only once** at creation. If you lose it, you must create a new key.
</Warning>

## Using API Keys

### Authentication Header

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://api.itellico.ai/v1/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-a1b2c3d4.xyz789..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Account Context

API keys are scoped to their account. When you create a key in a parent account, it can access both the parent and all subaccounts.

To access a specific account, include the account ID in the URL path:

```bash
# Access parent account
curl https://api.itellico.ai/v1/accounts/me/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-a1b2c3d4.xyz789..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Access specific subaccount
curl https://api.itellico.ai/v1/accounts/{account-id}/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-a1b2c3d4.xyz789..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### SDKs

Using our official SDKs:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from itellico import ItellicoAI

client = ItellicoAI(api_key="sk-a1b2c3d4.xyz789...")

# List agents
agents = client.agents.list()
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { ItellicoAI } from '@itellico/sdk';

const client = new ItellicoAI({
  apiKey: 'sk-a1b2c3d4.xyz789...'
});

// List agents
const agents = await client.agents.list();
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
Store API keys in environment variables and never hardcode them in your source code.
</Tip>

## Managing API Keys

### Viewing Keys

The API Keys page shows:
- **Label**: Your descriptive name
- **Partial Key**: First few characters (e.g., `sk-a1b2c3d4...`)
- **Status**: Active, Revoked, or Expired
- **Created**: When the key was created
- **Last Used**: When it was last used for an API request
- **Expires**: Expiration date (if set)

<Note>
The full key is **never** shown after creation - only the first few characters for identification.
</Note>

### Editing Keys

You can update:
- **Label**: Change the descriptive name
- **Expiration date**: Extend or set expiration

You **cannot** change:
- The key itself (create a new one instead)
- The account it belongs to

### Revoking Keys

To temporarily disable a key without deleting:

1. Go to **Settings → API Keys**
2. Find the key in the list
3. Click **Revoke**
4. The key is disabled immediately

**Why revoke instead of delete?**
- Keeps the key in logs for auditing
- Can reactivate if revoked by mistake
- Preserves creation date and history

### Reactivating Keys

To restore a revoked key:

1. Find the revoked key in the list
2. Click **Reactivate**
3. The key works immediately

### Deleting Keys

To permanently remove a key:

1. Go to **Settings → API Keys**
2. Find the key in the list
3. Click the menu (⋯) → **Delete**
4. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. The key will immediately stop working.
</Warning>

## Key Statuses

| Status | Description | API Access |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Active** | Key is working normally | ✅ Yes |
| **Revoked** | Manually disabled | ❌ No |
| **Expired** | Past expiration date | ❌ No |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="One Key Per Environment" icon="server">
    Create separate keys for each environment:

    - **Development**: "Dev Server Key"
    - **Staging**: "Staging Environment"
    - **Production**: "Production Server"

    **Benefits:**
    - Revoke dev keys without affecting production
    - Track usage by environment
    - Different expiration policies per environment
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Environment Variables" icon="code">
    Never hardcode API keys in your source code.

    **Good:**
    ```python
    import os
    api_key = os.environ['ITELLICO_API_KEY']
    ```

    **Bad:**
    ```python
    api_key = "sk-a1b2c3d4.xyz789..."  # DON'T DO THIS!
    ```

    **Environment files (.env):**
    ```bash
    ITELLICO_API_KEY=sk-a1b2c3d4.xyz789...
    ```

    **Add to .gitignore:**
    ```
    .env
    .env.local
    *.key
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regular Key Rotation" icon="rotate">
    Rotate API keys periodically for security:

    **Recommended schedule:**
    - **Production**: Every 90 days
    - **Staging**: Every 180 days
    - **Development**: Yearly or when developers change

    **Rotation process:**
    1. Create new key with expiration date
    2. Update applications with new key
    3. Test thoroughly
    4. Revoke old key
    5. Delete old key after 30 days
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set Expiration Dates" icon="calendar-xmark">
    Use expiration dates for:
    - **Temporary access**: Contractors, demos, POCs
    - **Forced rotation**: Production keys set to expire in 90 days
    - **Time-limited features**: Beta testing, trials

    **Example:**
    - Create key on Jan 1
    - Set expiration to Apr 1 (90 days)
    - Get notified 7 days before expiration
    - Rotate key before expiration
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Usage" icon="chart-line">
    Check "Last Used" timestamps regularly:

    - **Never used**: Delete unused keys
    - **Old timestamp**: Might be safe to revoke
    - **Recent activity**: Key is active

    Review your API keys monthly to remove inactive ones.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Descriptive Labels" icon="tag">
    Use clear, descriptive key names:

    **Good labels:**
    - "Production API Server - us-east-1"
    - "Mobile App - iOS - Production"
    - "CI/CD - GitHub Actions"
    - "Webhook Handler - Staging"

    **Bad labels:**
    - "API Key 1"
    - "Test"
    - "My Key"
    - "New Key"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Secrets Management" icon="vault">
    Use a secrets manager in production:

    **Options:**
    - AWS Secrets Manager
    - HashiCorp Vault
    - Azure Key Vault
    - Google Secret Manager
    - 1Password / LastPass (for teams)

    **Benefits:**
    - Centralized secret storage
    - Automatic rotation
    - Audit logs
    - Access controls
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
**Never commit API keys to version control!**

If you accidentally commit a key:
1. Revoke the key immediately
2. Create a new key
3. Use `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove from history
4. Force push to remote
5. Notify team members to pull latest
</Warning>

### If a Key is Compromised

<Steps>
  <Step title="Revoke Immediately">
    Go to **Settings → API Keys** and revoke the compromised key
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create New Key">
    Generate a replacement key with a new label
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Applications">
    Deploy the new key to all affected applications
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Logs">
    Check usage logs for suspicious activity
  </Step>

  <Step title="Notify Team">
    Inform your team about the incident
  </Step>

  <Step title="Investigate">
    Determine how the key was compromised and prevent recurrence
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="401 Unauthorized" icon="lock">
    **Causes:**
    - Invalid API key
    - Revoked or expired key
    - Missing `Authorization` header
    - Incorrect header format

    **Solutions:**
    - Verify the key is active in Settings
    - Check the header: `Authorization: Bearer sk-...`
    - Ensure no extra spaces or characters
    - Create a new key if lost
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="403 Forbidden" icon="ban">
    **Causes:**
    - Key doesn't have access to the requested account
    - Requesting a subaccount the key can't access
    - Account is inactive

    **Solutions:**
    - Verify the key was created in the parent account or the subaccount you're accessing
    - Check that the account ID in the URL is correct
    - Verify account status is active
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="429 Too Many Requests" icon="gauge-high">
    **Causes:**
    - Exceeded rate limits
    - Too many concurrent requests

    **Solutions:**
    - Implement exponential backoff
    - Cache responses when possible
    - Upgrade to higher tier plan
    - Spread requests over time
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Key not working after creation" icon="circle-xmark">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Using wrong key (prefix vs full key)
    - Extra characters (newlines, spaces)
    - Revoked immediately after creation

    **Solutions:**
    - Copy the full key including `sk-` prefix
    - Trim whitespace from stored key
    - Verify status is "Active"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many API keys can I create?">
    No hard limit, but we recommend:
    - Small teams: 3-5 keys
    - Medium teams: 10-15 keys
    - Enterprise: As needed per environment
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use one key across multiple accounts?">
    API keys created in a parent account can access both the parent and all its subaccounts. Keys created in a subaccount can only access that subaccount.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I delete a key?">
    API requests using that key will immediately fail with 401 Unauthorized. Update your applications first!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I see what a key was used for?">
    Yes. The "Last Used" timestamp shows when it was last accessed. For detailed logs, contact support about API access logs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do API keys expire automatically?">
    Only if you set an expiration date. Otherwise, keys remain active until revoked or deleted.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can subaccounts have their own API keys?">
    Yes! Each subaccount can create independent API keys scoped to that subaccount's context.
