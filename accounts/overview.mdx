## Overview

itellicoAI uses a hierarchical account system that allows you to organize your teams, manage access control, and scale your voice AI operations. Whether you're a single team or an enterprise with multiple departments, the accounts system provides flexibility and security.

## Account Types

### Main Accounts

Main accounts (also called "root accounts" or "parent accounts") are top-level organizations with:

- Independent billing and subscriptions
- Full administrative control
- Ability to create subaccounts (subscription dependent)
- Separate API keys and integrations

**Use cases:**
- Individual companies
- Agencies managing multiple clients
- Enterprises with distinct business units

### Subaccounts

Subaccounts are nested under parent accounts and provide:

- Isolated workspace for teams or clients
- Separate agents, contacts, and conversations
- Independent team members and permissions
- Shared billing with parent account

**Key characteristics:**
- Subaccounts can have their own subaccounts (keep nesting simple for easier management)
- Parent accounts can access child data
- Subaccounts **cannot** access parent or sibling data
- Each subaccount has its own owner and team

**Use cases:**
- Agency client workspaces
- Department separation within enterprises
- Regional or product-line divisions
- Reseller customer accounts

## Account Hierarchy

The system follows a parent-child hierarchy with strict access control:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Parent Account - Agency]
    A --> B[Subaccount A - Client 1]
    A --> C[Subaccount B - Client 2]
    A --> D[Subaccount C - Client 3]
    B --> E[Sub-subaccount A1 - Sales Team]
    B --> F[Sub-subaccount A2 - Support Team]
```

### Access Rules

- **Downward access**: Parents can access all child subaccounts
- **No upward access**: Children cannot access parent data
- **No sibling access**: Subaccounts cannot access each other
- **Context switching**: Users with multiple memberships can switch between accounts

## Common Use Cases
