## Creating a Main Account

Main accounts are independent organizations with their own billing and subscriptions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Account Switcher">
    Click your account name in the top navigation bar.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Create Account">
    At the bottom of the account switcher menu, click **Create Account**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Account Type">
    A modal appears with two options:
    - **New Account** - Create a completely separate account with its own billing and settings
    - **Subaccount** - Create a subaccount under your current account

    Select **New Account**.

<Frame>
  <div className="block dark:hidden">
    <img src="/images/accounts/create-account-light.png" alt="Create Account dialog showing New Account and Subaccount options with descriptions and Cancel button" />
  </div>
  <div className="hidden dark:block">
    <img src="/images/accounts/create-account-dark.png" alt="Create Account dialog showing New Account and Subaccount options with descriptions and Cancel button" />
  </div>
</Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Account Name">
    In the "Create New Account" modal:
    - Enter an account name (minimum 2 characters)
    - Click **Create Account**

<Frame>
  <div className="block dark:hidden">
    <img src="/images/accounts/create-main-acc-light.png" alt="Create New Account dialog with account name input field, Cancel and Create Account buttons" />
  </div>
  <div className="hidden dark:block">
    <img src="/images/accounts/create-main-acc-dark.png" alt="Create New Account dialog with account name input field, Cancel and Create Account buttons" />
  </div>
</Frame>

    You automatically become the **Owner** of the new account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Account Created">
    The new account is created immediately and you're automatically switched to it.

    The account starts with a **free subscription**. You can upgrade later by navigating to **Settings → Billing**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
New accounts start with a free subscription. Upgrade your plan to unlock additional features and higher limits.
</Note>

## Creating a Subaccount

Subaccounts are nested under parent accounts and share billing.

### Requirements

Before creating a subaccount:
- You must be an **Admin** or **Owner** of the parent account
- Your subscription must include subaccount management

<Warning>
If you don't see the option to create subaccounts, your current subscription plan may not include this feature. Contact [support@itellico.ai](mailto:support@itellico.ai) to upgrade.
</Warning>

### Steps to Create

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Subaccounts">
    Go to **Settings → Subaccounts** in your parent account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Subaccount">
    Click **Create Subaccount** and enter the name.

<Frame>
  <div className="block dark:hidden">
    <img src="/images/accounts/create-sub-acc-light.png" alt="Create Subaccount dialog with subaccount name input field, Cancel and Create Subaccount buttons" />
  </div>
  <div className="hidden dark:block">
    <img src="/images/accounts/create-sub-acc-dark.png" alt="Create Subaccount dialog with subaccount name input field, Cancel and Create Subaccount buttons" />
  </div>
</Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Team">
    You automatically become the **Owner** of the subaccount.

    Invite team members as needed from **Settings → Team**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Subaccounts inherit billing from the parent account. Usage is tracked separately but billed to the parent.
</Tip>

## Switching Between Accounts

If you're a member of multiple accounts, you can easily switch contexts:

1. Click your account name in the top navigation
2. Browse the account tree structure
3. Click any account to switch to it
4. All data, agents, and settings update to reflect the selected account

<Note>
The selected account persists per browser tab, allowing you to work in multiple accounts simultaneously in different tabs.
</Note>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Naming Conventions" icon="tag">
    Use clear, descriptive names for accounts:

    **Good:**
    - "Acme Corp - Sales Team"
    - "Client: XYZ Industries"
    - "North America Region"

    **Avoid:**
    - "Account 1"
    - "Test"
    - Ambiguous abbreviations
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Account Structure Planning" icon="sitemap">
    Plan your hierarchy before creating accounts:

    1. Map out your organizational structure
    2. Identify isolation boundaries (clients, departments, regions)
    3. Determine who needs access to what
    4. Create accounts top-down (parent first, then children)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Billing Considerations" icon="credit-card">
    Understand billing before creating subaccounts:

    - All subaccount usage bills to the parent
    - Usage is tracked separately for reporting
    - Subscription limits apply across all subaccounts
    - Consider usage limits when creating many subaccounts
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Ownership Assignment" icon="crown">
    Think carefully about who should own each account:

    - Main account owner: Usually company leadership
    - Subaccount owner: Client point of contact or department head
    - Can't easily change owners (requires support)
    - Owner has full control including deletion
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Managing Account Lifecycle

### Pausing an Account

To temporarily disable an account without deleting:

2. Change account status to **Inactive**
3. Account data is preserved but inaccessible to users

<Note>
Only Owners can deactivate accounts. Billing continues for inactive accounts.
</Note>

### Reactivating an Account

To restore an inactive account:

1. Contact support at support@itellico.ai
2. Provide the account name and UUID
3. Support will reactivate with all data intact

### Transferring Subaccounts

To move a subaccount to a different parent or make it a main account:

Contact support with:
- Current parent account name
- Subaccount to transfer
- Desired new parent (or "convert to main account")
- Business reason for transfer

<Warning>
Transferring subaccounts affects billing. Ensure you understand the billing implications before requesting a transfer.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't create subaccount" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Not an Admin or Owner of parent account
    - Subscription doesn't include subaccounts
    - Reached subscription limit on subaccounts

    **Solution:** Check your subscription plan. Contact [support@itellico.ai](mailto:support@itellico.ai) if you need to upgrade.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Don't see an account in switcher" icon="eye-slash">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Not a member of that account
    - Account was deactivated
    - Account was deleted

    **Solution:** Ask an admin of that account to check if it's active and if you're still a member.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Lost access after account switch" icon="lock">
    **This is normal behavior:** When you switch accounts, you only see data for that account.

    **Solution:** Switch back to the original account using the account switcher.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't delete an account" icon="trash">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Not the Owner of the account
    - Account has active subaccounts

    **Solution:** Only Owners can delete accounts. Delete or transfer subaccounts first.
