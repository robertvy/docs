## Telephony Integration

### SIP Trunking

itellicoAI uses custom SIP trunking to connect with your telephony provider. This approach gives you:

- **Flexibility:** Use your existing phone numbers and carrier relationships
- **Control:** Manage call routing and number provisioning through your provider
- **Scalability:** Handle high call volumes without platform limitations
- **Reliability:** Leverage enterprise-grade telephony infrastructure

### Phone Numbers

While itellicoAI doesn't provide direct phone number purchasing through the platform, we can provision phone numbers for you upon request. Contact our team to discuss your requirements.

Alternatively, bring your own numbers by:
- Using your existing business phone numbers
- Purchasing numbers through your preferred telephony provider
- Connecting via SIP trunk configuration
