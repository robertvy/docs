## Testing in Your Browser

The web simulator lets you test your agent quickly without making phone calls. Click **Test Agent** in the agent header to open the test panel on the right side. You can switch between **Web Call** and **Phone Call** tabs to test different scenarios.

## How to Run a Web Test

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your agent">
    Go to **AI Agents** and select the agent you want to test. Make sure your latest instructions are saved.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Test Agent">
    Click **Test Agent** in the top right corner. The test panel opens on the right side of the screen.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Web Call">
    Make sure **Web Call** is selected at the top of the test panel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start testing">
    Click **Start Test**. A call widget appears so you can talk with your agent using your microphone or by typing messages.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Test Variables

Test variables let you simulate different scenarios without changing your agent's instructions:

- All variables you've defined in your greeting and instruction appear in the test panel
- Update values to test different situations (e.g., "VIP customer", "Trial account")
- Click **Save Changes** to keep these values for future tests

## During the Test Call

After clicking **Start Test**, a call widget appears with these features:

- **Connection status** - See if the call is connecting, listening, or speaking
- **Live transcription** - Read what you and the agent are saying in real-time
- **Action tracking** - See when the agent triggers actions like transfers or bookings
- **Call controls** - Minimize, maximize, or end the call
- **Stays active** - Widget remains open even if you navigate to other pages

You can continue working in the dashboard while the test call is active.

## Reviewing Test Results

After ending a test call:

1. Go to the **Conversations** tab in the main navigation
2. Find your test call (most recent at the top)
3. Review the transcript, goals achieved, and any actions triggered
4. Listen to audio playback if needed
5. Check that everything worked as expected

<Tip>
You can delete test conversations to keep your conversation history focused on real customer interactions.
</Tip>

## When to Switch to Phone Testing

Use the web simulator for fast iteration, but switch to phone testing when you need to:

- Test voice quality and natural speech timing
- Verify answering machine detection (AMD) settings
- Test call transfers to real phone numbers
- Confirm the experience matches what customers will hear

<Note>
**Performance Differences:** Web tests use WebRTC with high-quality codecs and have no PSTN infrastructure involved, so latency is faster and audio quality is higher than phone calls. Always test with real phone calls before launch to experience what your customers will actually hear.
</Note>

See the [phone testing guide](/test/phone-testing) for detailed instructions on testing with real phone calls.
