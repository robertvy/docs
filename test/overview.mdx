## Why Testing Matters

Testing your voice agent ensures it handles conversations correctly, responds appropriately to customer questions, and executes actions reliably. A thorough test catches issues with instructions, knowledge retrieval, and integrations before your agent goes live.

## How to Test Your Agent

## Recommended Testing Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up your agent">
    Complete your agent's instructions, attach knowledge bases, and configure any actions like transfers or bookings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test with Web Simulator">
    Click **Test Agent** in the agent header and start a web call. Verify greetings, instructions, and responses work as expected. Iterate quickly by editing and retesting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test with Phone Calls">
    Call your agent's phone number to test the complete phone experience - listen for voice quality, timing, and natural conversation flow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Conversation Logs">
    Open your test calls in the Conversations tab. Review transcripts, verify goals were tracked, and check that post-call automations triggered correctly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Edge Cases">
    Try interrupting the agent, providing unexpected answers, and triggering error scenarios to ensure graceful handling.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What to Test

Make sure to validate these key aspects before launching:

- **Greeting & Introduction** - Agent introduces itself correctly and sets context
- **Instructions & Responses** - Agent follows your instructions and answers questions accurately
- **Knowledge Base Access** - Agent retrieves and uses information from your knowledge bases
- **Actions & Integrations** - Transfers, bookings, and API calls work reliably
- **Error Handling** - Agent handles misunderstandings and unexpected inputs gracefully
- **Conversation Flow** - Natural back-and-forth without awkward pauses or interruptions
- **Goal Tracking** - Conversation goals are marked correctly for analytics
