# Service Level Agreement (SLA)

**Last Updated:** August 1, 2024

itellico places the highest value on quality! This Service Level Agreement (SLA) offers our customers a transparent way to monitor these quality features.

## Enterprise SLA Notice

**Important:** This Service Level Agreement is **not included** in itellico's standard service offerings. This SLA is exclusively available to **Enterprise customers** and requires a **separate written agreement**. Standard customers are covered under our Best Effort support terms without specific availability guarantees or service credits.

To inquire about Enterprise SLA coverage, please contact our sales team at [sales@itellico.ai](mailto:sales@itellico.ai).

## AI Solutions

itellico offers state-of-the-art AI voice assistants deployed on a robust and scalable cloud infrastructure. This architecture ensures maximum scalability, reliability, and performance for our customers.

We consistently use the latest AI models and advanced technologies. Our B2B voice assistants benefit from these cutting-edge technologies to enable precise and efficient interactions.

By using these state-of-the-art technologies and continuously monitoring and integrating new developments in the field of AI, itellico ensures that its services are always at the forefront of technology.

However, it should be noted that the availability and performance of the AI models depend also on the respective providers and their infrastructural conditions. Therefore, itellico cannot assume liability or warranty for response speed, delays, performance degradation, or other impairments caused by external factors and/or third-party providers.

With this strategy, itellico strives to always offer its customers the highest quality and efficiency in the use of AI technologies, while simultaneously ensuring the continuous development and improvement of the offered services.

## Support

All customers already have a support package included in their product via the itellico Support Center! All customers are assured at least email support via [support@itellico.ai](mailto:support@itellico.ai).

## Performance and Latency Standards

Since latency depends on many factors, including network infrastructure and third-party services, itellico assumes no liability for exceeding certain latency times. Therefore, itellico cannot be held responsible for delays caused by external technology service providers or other circumstances beyond itellico's control.

### Measurement and Monitoring

Performance metrics are measured from itellico's infrastructure endpoints. The following are excluded from performance calculations:

  * End-user network latency and connectivity issues
  * Third-party service dependencies (external APIs, cloud providers)
  * Requests during scheduled maintenance windows
  * Extraordinary network conditions or DDoS attacks

### Performance Remedies

If performance standards are not met consistently over a **7-day period** :

Degradation Level | Description | Remedy  
---|---|---  
**Minor Degradation** | 10-20% above targets | Technical review and optimization plan  
**Significant Degradation** | >20% above targets | 5% service credit applied to affected period  
**Severe Degradation** | >50% above targets | 10% service credit and immediate escalation to senior technical team  

Performance is measured using industry-standard monitoring tools and reported monthly to clients upon request.

## Availability

itellico guarantees an availability of 99% during business hours (Monday-Friday 09:00 - 18:00 CET/CEST, hereinafter "Business Hours") and 98% during the remaining time. Availability is measured over a calendar year. For the calculation of Service Credits (see section "Service Credits"), the average monthly availability is used and evaluated quarterly. Availability is calculated by comparing the number of seconds the service is available with the total number of seconds in the measurement period. This availability excludes scheduled maintenance work. The service is considered unavailable if reported in writing by the customer via email or if itellico itself detects the fault, whichever occurs earlier. The service is considered available again once the fault has been resolved and there is consensus between the customer and itellico. Times when the service is unavailable due to planned maintenance work are excluded if announced at least 48 hours in advance via email.

The availability described above does not include the availability of third-party services, such as cloud services or external AI models. itellico is not liable for failures or impairments caused by the unavailability of such third-party services.

## Maintenance Window

A maintenance window is scheduled every Wednesday from 22:00 to 06:00 CET/CEST. Interruptions during this period are not included in the overall availability calculation. Availability is represented as a percentage, indicating the minimum share of the total operating time for which the respective service is available. The value is determined over a period of one operating year (12 months) from the deployment date.

## Response Time and Resolution Time

Severity Level | Description | Response Time | Target Resolution Time  
---|---|---|---  
**Severity 1** | Critical: Service is completely down or core functionality unavailable, significantly impacting business operations with no workaround available. | 1 Business Hour | 4 Business Hours  
**Severity 2** | High: Important functionality impaired, restricting business operations. Workaround is difficult to apply. | 4 Business Hours | 1 Business Day  
**Severity 3** | Medium: Non-critical functionality impaired, performance reduced. Business operations not significantly hindered. Workaround may be available. | 1 Business Day | 5 Business Days  
**Severity 4** | Low: Minor issues, cosmetic errors, documentation questions, or inquiries. | 2 Business Days | Next maintenance cycle or at discretion  

If confirmation of incident acceptance or resolution cannot occur or is delayed for reasons beyond itellico's control (e.g., missing information or customer cooperation), this is considered an external delay and is not included in the time calculation. After confirming incident acceptance, fault isolation will begin immediately. If difficulties arise during fault isolation or resolution, itellico support will inform the customer about the estimated duration.

## Scope of Services and Changes to Services

The type and scope of services provided by itellico depend on the state of the art, the availability of global internet connections, and the services of third-party providers such as cloud service providers, and are provided based on the current state of technology. To maintain the quality of services, itellico may change the configuration of the services within reasonable limits for the customer, as long as the essential character of the agreed service is not altered or is replaced by an equivalent service.

Claims for compensation for failure to meet agreed service level values exist only if expressly agreed upon in writing. Maintenance work on cloud solutions may affect the contractual services. Weekly standard maintenance windows will be communicated separately to the customer. itellico will endeavor to perform planned maintenance work within these windows. Changes to maintenance windows will be announced to the customer, where possible, five days in advance. In case of unforeseen disruptions, itellico will inform the customer within the agreed deadlines and strive to resolve the disruption. The customer must cooperate in this process.

## Disclaimer for Third-Party Services

The availability and response/resolution times described in this SLA do not include the availability or performance of third-party services, such as cloud services or external AI models. itellico is not liable for failures, delays, or impairments caused by the unavailability or performance issues of such third-party services.

## Burden of Proof for All SLA Claims

### SLA Monitoring and Reporting

itellico maintains internal monitoring systems to track service performance against the commitments outlined in this SLA. However, due to the distributed nature of our services and dependencies on third-party providers, **customers are responsible for monitoring their own service experience** and reporting issues promptly.

### Customer Responsibilities for SLA Claims

Customers seeking service credits or disputing SLA compliance must provide:

  * **Incident details** including dates, times, and description of the service impact
  * **Evidence of proper incident reporting** through designated support channels
  * **Documentation of business impact** related to the alleged SLA violation
  * **Confirmation of compliance** with service usage guidelines and requirements

### itellico's Monitoring and Evidence

Upon receipt of a properly documented SLA claim, itellico will:

  * **Investigate the reported incident** using internal monitoring data
  * **Provide relevant service metrics** for the disputed time period
  * **Collaborate with the customer** to understand the root cause
  * **Determine appropriate remedies** if an SLA violation is confirmed

### Dispute Resolution Process

If there is disagreement about SLA compliance:

  * **Initial Review:** itellico will examine customer evidence and internal metrics
  * **Joint Analysis:** Both parties will review available data to identify discrepancies
  * **Third-Party Assessment:** For unresolved disputes, an independent technical review may be conducted
  * **Final Determination:** itellico will make the final decision based on all available evidence

### Exclusions from SLA Coverage

SLA commitments do not apply to service impacts caused by:

  * **Third-party service providers** (cloud infrastructure, AI model providers, external APIs)
  * **Customer infrastructure** (network connectivity, local systems, configurations)
  * **Force majeure events** or circumstances beyond itellico's reasonable control
  * **Customer actions** (misuse, non-compliance with service requirements, delayed cooperation)

When issues are attributable to these excluded factors, no SLA violation will be recognized, and no service credits will be issued.

## Service Credits for Failure to Meet Availability

Should the guaranteed availability defined in the "Availability" section (averaged over Business Hours and the remaining time) not be met in a calendar quarter, the customer is entitled to a service credit ("Service Credit") on the fees for the affected service in the following quarter, provided all due invoices have been paid. The amount of the credit is tiered as follows:

Quarterly Availability Range | Service Credit Percentage of Net Quarterly Fee  
---|---  
< 99% but >= 98.0% | 5%  
< 98.0% | 10%  

The maximum credit per quarter is limited to 15% of the net quarterly fee for the affected service. Service Credits are the customer's sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet availability commitments.

## Notices and Exclusions

This SLA applies to customers with a valid contract for the affected services. The entitlement to a credit first arises for the calendar quarter following the date of contract signing.

All claims under this SLA, particularly for Service Credits, are excluded if not asserted by the customer in writing via email to [support@itellico.ai](mailto:support@itellico.ai) within **five (5)** business days after the end of the affected calendar quarter, stating the relevant details (period of unavailability, affected service). At most, the credit calculated according to the "Service Credits" section will be granted per service and billing period.

No credit will be granted, and availability calculations, as well as response/resolution times, are not applicable if the failure to meet the standards is due to the following causes:

  * Scheduled maintenance work according to the "Maintenance Window" section.
  * Force majeure or circumstances beyond itellico's reasonable control.
  * Failures or performance issues of third-party services (cloud infrastructure, external AI models, customer's internet connections, etc.).
  * Acts or omissions of the customer or third parties acting on behalf of the customer (e.g., misconfigurations, improper use, exceeding usage limits).
  * Suspension or termination of access by itellico according to the itellico Terms and Conditions.
  * Security incidents caused by the actions of the customer or third parties.
