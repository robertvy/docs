**b) Liability Cap:** To the extent permitted by law, itellico's total aggregate liability for all claims arising out of or in connection with this Agreement per damage event and contract year, regardless of the legal grounds (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise), shall be limited to the amount that the User paid to itellico for the affected Services in the six (6) months immediately preceding the damage-causing event. This limitation applies to damages caused by gross negligence, but does not apply in cases of intent or personal injury.

**c) Consequential Damages:** To the maximum extent permitted by law, itellico shall not be liable for any indirect or consequential damages, including but not limited to lost profits, loss of revenue, or loss of data, even if such damages were foreseeable.

**d) AI-Generated Outputs:** itellico assumes no liability for the correctness, completeness, or suitability of Outputs generated by the Services. The User is solely responsible for verifying and validating all Outputs before use and accepts all risks associated therewith.

**e) Unaffected Liability:** The foregoing limitations of liability shall not apply in cases of mandatory statutory liability, in particular liability under the Austrian Product Liability Act (Produkthaftungsgesetz) or for any express guarantees (Garantiezusagen) made by itellico.

**f) Enterprise SLA Customers:** For Enterprise customers with a separately executed Service Level Agreement, the liability provisions of that SLA shall take precedence over this Section 16.1.

**16.2. User Indemnification:** User indemnifies itellico against third-party claims (including claims from itellico's sub-processors and service providers) arising from: (a) User's Inputs/Outputs or their use; (b) User's Service use; or (c) User's breach of responsibilities, unless claims result from itellico's intentional misconduct or gross negligence. Indemnification includes reasonable legal defense costs.

# Part VII: Changes, Disputes, & Ending the Relationship

## 17. Changes to Terms or Services

itellico reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time to adapt to changing legal, technical, or economic conditions. itellico will notify the User of any material changes via the Administrator Email or a prominent notice within the Admin Portal at least thirty (30) days before the changes take effect.

The notification will highlight the proposed modifications. If the User does not agree with the changes, their sole remedy is to terminate the Agreement in accordance with Section 18 before the effective date of the new terms. The User's continued use of the Services after the effective date will be deemed acceptance of the amended Terms.

Changes required by mandatory law or to address an urgent security vulnerability may take effect immediately, and itellico will inform Users as soon as reasonably possible.

## 18. Service Suspension & Agreement Termination

**18.1. Termination by User:** The User may terminate the Agreement according to the terms of their Subscription Plan:

- a) **Annual Subscription Plans:** For subscriptions with an annual billing cycle, the User must provide written termination notice at least three (3) months prior to the end of the current annual term. If notice is not provided within this timeframe, the subscription will automatically renew for another year.
- b) **Monthly Subscription Plans:** For subscriptions with a monthly billing cycle, the User may cancel their subscription at any time. The cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing period, and the User will not be charged for the subsequent month.

**18.2. Termination for Cause:**

- a) Either party may terminate this Agreement for cause upon written notice if the other party:
- b) itellico may also terminate this Agreement immediately and without a cure period if the User commits a serious violation of critical obligations, including but not limited to those in Section 7 (Acceptable Use), Section 9 (Intellectual Property Rights), or payment obligations as specified in Section 13.2.a.
- c) In any situation giving itellico the right to terminate, itellico may, at its sole discretion, choose to suspend the User's access to the Services as an alternative to termination.

18.3. Service Suspension:

- a) itellico may temporarily interrupt/suspend access without prior notice if:
- i) immediate action for security/abuse prevention,
- ii) usage indicates potential violations of Section 7.2 (Acceptable Use Policy) or Section 7 (User Responsibilities),
- iii) content violations or unlawful content,
- iv) data protection law violations (GDPR),
- v) maintenance/emergency interventions. Reasonable efforts for advance notice and minimizing disruption.
- b) If suspension attributable to User, resumption may occur at itellico's discretion after User pays resumption costs and reason eliminated. Suspension doesn't release from fee payment.
- c) Suspension for security threats: if User's use breaches terms threatening security/stability/availability, itellico may suspend immediately. Commercially reasonable efforts for prior notice/rectification, unless severity needs immediate action.

18.4. Consequences of Termination (General):

- a) All User rights/licenses terminate; User ceases Service use.
- b) Each party, on request, returns/destroys other's Confidential Information (subject to legal retention/backup protocols and Section 11 on Confidentiality Obligations).

## 19. Consequences of Termination & Data Handling

**19.1. Data Portability, Deletion, and Post-Termination Data Access:** Upon termination or expiration of the Agreement for any reason, itellico is no longer obligated to provide the Services or maintain User data. User is expressly informed and acknowledges that itellico is entitled to delete all Inputs, Outputs, and other data associated with the User's Account that may be stored or held by itellico, unless otherwise prohibited by mandatory applicable law.

For a period of ninety (90) days following termination/expiration (provided the User has no outstanding payments due to itellico), itellico will, upon User's request, provide the User with the capability to export their Inputs and Outputs as defined in Section 9.4, using itellico's standard data export functionalities available at that time. The timely retrieval and backup of all such data before the expiry of this 90-day period is the sole and exclusive responsibility of the User.

The User explicitly acknowledges that they have no claim to receive any of itellico's proprietary software or tools that might have been used to process or manage the data within the Services. Consequently, exported data may require other compatible software for access or use, and itellico makes no representation or warranty regarding the usability, format, or full functional compatibility of exported data with non-itellico systems. itellico shall have no liability for the User's inability to access, process, or fully utilize exported data outside of the Services.

After this 90-day period, itellico is obligated to irrevocably delete all such data from its systems in accordance with the Data Processing Agreement. The User can derive no claims against itellico from the deletion of data in accordance with this section.

## 20. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution

**20.1. Governing Law:** Substantive Austrian law applies (excluding conflict-of-law rules, renvoi, and the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods). For all disputes arising from or in connection with the business relationship (including the validity of the jurisdiction agreement), the parties agree that the competent court at itellico's seat has exclusive jurisdiction.

**20.2. Alternative Dispute Resolution:**

- a) **Mandatory Mediation**: Before initiating court proceedings, parties shall attempt good faith resolution through mediation administered by the Vienna International Arbitral Centre (VIAC) or another mutually acceptable mediation service. Either party may initiate mediation by written notice.
