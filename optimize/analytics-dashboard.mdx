The **Dashboard** gives you quantitative insights into agent performance. Track key metrics over time, identify trends, and measure the impact of changes.

**Access:** Navigate to **Dashboard** in the main menu, or check campaign-specific metrics in **Campaigns → [Campaign] → Dashboard** and **Reporting** tabs

## Key Metrics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Goal Achievement Rate" icon="bullseye">
    **What it measures:** Percentage of conversations where configured goals were achieved

    **Target benchmarks:**
    - ✅ Excellent: &gt;85%
    - 👍 Good: 70-85%
    - ⚠️ Needs improvement: &lt;70%

    **How to improve:**
    - Review failed conversations to spot patterns
    - Add missing knowledge for common failure reasons
    - Refine goal definitions for accuracy
    - Update instructions to handle edge cases

    Configure goals in **Agent Settings → Analytics → Goals**. See [Conversation Goals](/build/analytics/conversation-goals).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Answer Rate (Campaigns)" icon="phone">
    **What it measures:** Percentage of campaign contacts who answered the phone

    **Target:** Varies by industry (30-60% typical)

    **How to improve:**
    - Use the answer rate heat map to find best calling times
    - Update business hours to focus on high-performing windows
    - Avoid early mornings, late evenings, and weekends unless data supports it
    - Test different days/times for your specific audience

    Only available for campaigns. View in campaign **Dashboard** tab under Answer Rate Heat Map.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transfer Rate" icon="phone-arrow-up-right">
    **What it measures:** Percentage of conversations transferred to humans

    **Target benchmarks:**
    - ✅ Excellent: &lt;15%
    - 👍 Good: 15-25%
    - ⚠️ Needs improvement: &gt;25%

    **How to improve:**
    - Review transcripts that led to transfers
    - Add knowledge or actions to handle common transfer reasons
    - Update instructions to handle more scenarios in automation
    - Set clearer criteria for when transfers are appropriate

    Note: Some transfers are expected (e.g., legal questions, escalations). Focus on reducing unnecessary transfers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Average Call Duration" icon="clock">
    **What it measures:** Mean length of all conversations

    **Target:** Varies by use case (2-4 min support, 3-8 min sales, 1-3 min booking)

    **How to interpret:**
    - ⬆️ Increasing: Agent may be verbose, slow knowledge retrieval, or handling complex issues
    - ⬇️ Decreasing: Agent more efficient OR dropping calls early
    - 📊 Stable: Consistent performance

    **How to improve:**
    - Shorten agent responses (remove repetitive phrases)
    - Optimize knowledge base structure
    - Streamline conversation flow (ask for info upfront)
    - Create shortcuts for frequent scenarios
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Action Success Rate" icon="wrench">
    **What it measures:** Percentage of triggered actions that execute successfully

    **Target benchmarks:**
    - ✅ Excellent: &gt;95%
    - 👍 Good: 90-95%
    - ⚠️ Needs improvement: &lt;90%

    **Common failures:**
    - API endpoints down or slow
    - Authentication failures
    - Incorrect parameters
    - Network timeouts

    **How to improve:**
    - Monitor API health and response times
    - Improve parameter extraction instructions
    - Add retry logic for transient failures
    - Better error handling in actions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Completion Rate" icon="circle-check">
    **What it measures:** Percentage of conversations that complete normally (vs drop/error)

    **Target:** &gt;95%

    **Low completion indicates:**
    - Technical issues (audio, connectivity)
    - Poor user experience causing hang-ups
    - Confusing conversation flow
    - Long wait times or latency issues
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cost Per Conversation" icon="dollar-sign">
    **What it measures:** Average cost to handle one complete conversation

    **Typical ranges:**
    - Simple Q&A: $0.10 - $0.30
    - Support: $0.20 - $0.50
    - Sales: $0.40 - $1.00+

    **Cost components:**
    - LLM inference (40-60%)
    - Text-to-Speech (20-35%)
    - Speech-to-Text (15-25%)
    - Knowledge operations (small %)

    Track trends over time to spot cost increases and measure optimization impact.

## Filters and Date Ranges

Use filters to analyze specific slices of your data:

**Date Range:**
- Today, Yesterday, Last 7 days, Last 30 days
- This month, Last month
- Custom range

**Agent Filter:** Isolate performance of specific agents or compare multiple

**Phone Number Filter:** Track calls to/from specific numbers

**Status Filter:** Filter by outcome (completed, failed, transferred)

**Campaign Filter:** For campaign calls, filter by campaign name

## Campaign Dashboard & Reporting

For outbound campaigns, each campaign has **Dashboard** and **Reporting** tabs with campaign-specific insights:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Answer Rate Heat Map" icon="chart-line">
    Weekly heat map showing answer rates by hour and day. After 50-100 calls, use this to identify the best calling times and optimize your business hours configuration.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Goal Performance" icon="bullseye">
    Track campaign goal achievement rates per contact. See which contacts completed objectives and analyze success patterns.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Contact Analytics" icon="users">
    Per-contact metrics combining all conversations, status history, and analysis results for comprehensive insights.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Call Volume" icon="phone-volume">

## Weekly Review Routine

Make dashboard review a habit:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check for anomalies">
    Look for sudden drops or spikes in any metric. Did something change recently?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Compare to last week">
    Are metrics trending up or down? What changed between periods?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Dig into outliers">
    If a metric is off, switch to **Conversations** view to review specific calls and understand why.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust based on data">
    Use insights to update instructions, knowledge, business hours, or actions. Test changes and monitor impact next week.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Metric Combinations

Look at metrics together for deeper insights:

**Goal Achievement + Transfer Rate:**
- Low goals, high transfers → Agent can't handle scope
- High goals, low transfers → Excellent automation ✅
- Low both → Fundamental issues

**Duration + Goal Achievement:**
- Long duration, high goals → Thorough but slow
- Short duration, high goals → Efficient and effective ✅
- Long duration, low goals → Struggling to help
- Short duration, low goals → Failing fast

**Action Success + Goal Achievement:**
- High action success, high goals → Actions driving success ✅
- Low action success, low goals → Broken integrations hurting outcomes

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Focus on trends, not absolutes" icon="chart-line">
    Weekly changes matter more than single-day numbers. Look for patterns over 2-4 weeks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Combine quantitative + qualitative" icon="chart-mixed">
    Dashboard shows what's happening. Conversations view shows why. Use both.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set baselines before optimizing" icon="ruler">
    Run for 1-2 weeks to establish baselines. Then make one change at a time and measure impact.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Export for long-term tracking" icon="file-export">
    Don't rely solely on dashboard. Export monthly for records and trend analysis in Excel or BI tools.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Act on insights" icon="bolt">
    Measurement without action is wasted. Set improvement targets, make changes, test, iterate.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
