After launching your agent, the real work begins: learning from production conversations and making targeted improvements. itellicoAI gives you two ways to optimize:

## Two Paths to Improvement

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Review Conversations" icon="messages" href="/optimize/review-conversations">
    Review calls, read transcripts, and check goal results to understand what's actually happening in individual conversations
  </Card>

  <Card title="Dashboard" icon="chart-line" href="/optimize/analytics-dashboard">
    Track metrics over time to measure success, spot trends, and identify improvement opportunities
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Quick Weekly Routine

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check metrics">
    Review key metrics in **Dashboard** (goal achievement, transfers, duration) and campaign **Dashboard** or **Reporting** tabs (answer rates, call volume). Look for sudden drops or improvements.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sample conversations">
    Go to **Conversations** and review 5-10 calls. Filter by failures, transfers, or low goal achievement to find improvement opportunities.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make adjustments">
    Based on what you learned:
    - Update agent instructions for common scenarios
    - Add missing knowledge to knowledge bases
    - Refine goals or post-call analysis questions
    - Adjust business hours based on heat map insights
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test and deploy">
    Test your changes using the web simulator, then deploy. Monitor the impact in next week's metrics.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The Feedback Loop

Every conversation generates data you can learn from:

1. **During the call:** Agent follows instructions, uses knowledge, executes actions
2. **After the call:** Goals are scored, post-call analysis runs, conversation is logged
3. **You review:** Check individual calls or aggregate metrics
4. **You improve:** Update instructions, knowledge, or configuration
5. **Repeat:** Monitor impact and continue refining
